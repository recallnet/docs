You can control access to data that is written to Recall through _credit approval_ flows, giving
multi-writer access to your agent's bucket. For now, the data is public by default and readable by
anyone.

<Callout type="warn">

In its current state, data on Recall is not private. If you do have private data, **be sure to
encrypt the data** before storing it. In the future, we're looking to incorporate different types of
access control to help with _both_ read and write access patterns. You can learn more in the
[data privacy](/advanced/sources/privacy) section.

</Callout>

## Access control

All access control patterns are handled for write operations. The credit system can be used to
provision access for others to act as delegates to your account.

For example, by creating credit approvals from your account `A`, you can:

- Provision account `B` to write to `A`'s bucket and use any credits (or virtual gas) they own
- Provision another account `C` to write to `A`'s bucket, but limit how many credits and gas they
  can use, along with an expiration period

Thus, a common pattern in agent flows is to:

- Create an admin wallet `A` and purchase credits for it
- Create an agent wallet `B` and provision it as a delegate from `A`
- Whenever you configure agent plugins, use the bucket created by the admin wallet `A`

You could imagine more complex flows as well, with multiple admins, agents, and different
configurations.

## How to manage access

Practically, the Recall CLI's [`credit` subcommand](/advanced/tools/cli/account#credit) makes it
easy to manage this process. The general flow is:

1. Use the `credit approve` subcommand to provision access to the account—and optionally, define a
   limit on the credits and virtual gas, with an expiration block
2. A provisioned account can set their default _sponsor_ to the provisioner
3. If you want to revoke access, use the `credit revoke` subcommand

<Steps>

<Step>

### Create an approval

You start by creating an approval from the provisioner account to the delegate account, along with
optional constraints:

```bash
recall account credit approve \
  --to <delegate_address> \
  --credit-limit <amount> \
  --gas-fee-limit <amount> \
  --ttl <seconds>
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Configure a default sponsor

At this point, the delegate can write to the account's bucket. Now, we want to make sure the
delegate will use the approval by default, thus, always drawing down from the sponsor's credit and
virtual gas balances. Execute the following from the delegate account to set the sponsor:

```bash
recall account sponsor set <sponsor_address>
```

Any time data is stored in a bucket _owned by the sponsor_, the _sponsor_ will be charged the
credits and virtual gas. If the delegate did not execute this step, they would, instead, be charged
from their own credit and virtual gas balances.

<Callout type="warn">

Buckets and data created _by_ the delegate will not use the sponsor's credit and virtual gas
balances. The delegate is charged from their own balances.

</Callout>

A delegate can only have one sponsor at a time. To remove a sponsor, you must execute the
`sponsor unset` command.

</Step>

<Step>

### Revoke an approval

To revoke an approval, you can use the `recall account credit revoke` subcommand from the sponsor's
account. This will disable the delegate from writing to the bucket or using the sponsor's credit and
virtual gas balances.

```bash
recall account credit revoke --to <delegate_address>
```

</Step>

</Steps>
