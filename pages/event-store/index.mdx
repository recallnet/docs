Ceramic's decentralized data network provides Web3 developers with a collection of features that make it possible to build scalable Web3 applications with composable data that can be reused and shared across applications. Data written to Ceramic has the following unique properties:

- **Verifiability**: All data written to Ceramic is signed by its author, meaning data on Ceramic is self-certifying and trustworthy.
- **Composability**: Data in Ceramic is organized by [models](/event-store/concepts). When applications use the same data models, the data they create can be viewed as one, universal dataset. Ceramic makes it easy to compose data from distinct applications and users into a single, hackable dataset.
- **Scalable**: Data in Ceramic is sharded by author by default. In exchange for giving up transactionality, Ceramic elegantly scales to massive datasets.
- **Secure**: Ceramic gains a sense of time by [anchoring](#) its data to a blockchain, which allows Ceramic nodes to assert when data was created. Ceramic uses this sense of time to implement expiring user sessions, meaning one compromised session keypair doesn't permanently taint a user's identity.
- **Private**: Ceramic makes it possible for users to determine what data is shared with which entities at what time.
