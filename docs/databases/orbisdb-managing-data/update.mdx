title: Updating data (`UPDATE`)
description: Learn how to update data in OrbisDB.
---

Once written, data can be updated. This is basic database functionality and it's readily available.

## Flow of data

Check out [Writing data](/databases/orbisdb-managing-data/insert), since the same logic is being
used to update it. The underlying Ceramic data is updated and picked up by OrbisDB instances
subscribed to its [Models](/databases/orbisdb-managing-data/models).

The indexing process includes [Context](/databases/orbisdb-managing-data/contexts) checks,
validation done by [Plugins](/databases/orbisdb-plugins), etc. Indexed data is then queried from
OrbisDB directly, but is linked to the underlying Ceramic data via the Stream ID.

## `UPDATE` in OrbisDB

Data updates may happen when explicitly requested by the user or due to
[Account Relation](/databases/orbisdb-managing-data/models#account-relation) restrictions. When
trying to write new data with `single` or `set` Account Relation constraints, the already existing
data is updated instead.

All update operations are handled by the `update`
[SDK method](/databases/orbisdb-sdk-reference/update).

### Code example

#### Update an entire row

When using `replace` the entire row is replaced (all columns), but the `row id` remains the same.

```jsx
// This will replace the provided row with provided values
const result = await orbis
  .update("ROW_ID")
  .replace({
    column: value,
    column2: value2,
  })
  .run();
```

#### Update a row partially

In this case, only columns defined in the `set` statement will be updated. The method will perform a
shallow merge with the existing data.

```jsx
// { ...oldContent, ...newContent }
const result = await orbis
  .update("ROW_ID")
  .set({
    column: value,
  })
  .run();
```

## Summary

When updating data the same flow applies as it does when
[writing data](/databases/orbisdb-managing-data/insert). Ceramic is used as the source of truth from
which OrbisDB Nodes index updated data. Run an update query using `orbis.update` and you're ready to
go.

The general flow when updating data looks like this:

1. End user triggers and signs the update (SDK)
   1. Alternatively, the user tries to create a new entry using a Model that has `single` or `set`
      [Account Relation](/databases/orbisdb-managing-data/models#account-relation) contraints
2. The data is sent to Ceramic by the end user directly (SDK)
3. OrbisDB picks up and processes Ceramic events
4. Plugins are used to validate and enrich the data
5. If the data passes all the checks, its then upserted in PostgreSQL
6. Plugins get the final state of data, allowing them to do post-processing operations
