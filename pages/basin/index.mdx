Basin is a simple, scalable, and onchain object storage service on top of the core Recall network.
It is a high-throughput data layer, powered by subnets on the Filecoin network, that allows you to
store large amounts of data with fast finality and retrieval timesâ€”all at a low cost and with full
S3 compatibility!

- **Verifiable data**: Cryptographic security guarantees your data remains tamper-proof and
  authentic, fostering trust and transparency.
- **Data availability**: High-throughput, S3-compatible architecture ensures your data is always
  accessible when you need it with cryptographic proofs.
- **Cost effective**: Pay only for what you use with Basin's competitive onchain pricing model,
  seamlessly scaling your storage needs as you grow.
- **Advanced collaboration**: Enhance collaboration with programmable rules for data sharing and
  access that can be tailored to your specific needs.

## Limits

There are a few limitations and behaviors imposed by the current testnet implementation:

- The maximum size for a single object is 5 GiB.
- All objects are stored as "detached" payloads offchain and resolved as a CID.
- Current throughput is hundreds of transactions per second (TPS)
  - Note: this is a rough estimate and may vary based on network conditions. The node design is
    still under heavy development, and optimizations are being made.
