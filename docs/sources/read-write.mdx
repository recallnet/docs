Once you've created a data source, you have full control over it. By default, only the owner of a
bucket can write to it, but _anyone_ can read from it if they know the contract address.

## Writing data

To write data to a bucket, you can use the `recall bucket add` command. Executing the write
operation will send the data to the network in two steps:

1. Stage the data with the validator whose RPCs / APIs it is calling
2. Finalize the data onchain with a transaction, which creates the key-value mapping in the bucket

```sh
recall bucket add \
--address 0xff0000000000000000000000000000000000008f \
--key "hello/world" \
~/data/hello.txt
```

<Callout type="info">

Note that **every object has a default TTL of 24 hours (86400 seconds)**. If you need a longer
retention period, you can use the `--ttl` flag to set a custom TTL (in seconds).

</Callout>

Once executed, the output will include the object's hash and size, along with the actual
transaction:

```json
Added object in 1 second (hash=rzghyg4z3p6vbz5jkgc75lk64fci7kieul65o6hk6xznx7lctkmq; size=6)

{
  "transactionHash": "0x6ef9...",
  "transactionIndex": "0x0",
  "blockHash": "0xf258...",
  "blockNumber": "0x10a59",
  "from": "0x90f79bf6eb2c4f870365e785982e1f101e93b906",
  "to": "0xff0000000000000000000000000000000000008f",
  ...
}
```

Sending the data should only take a second or two, and then the data will be available to read from
the bucket immediately. You'll notice the `rzghyg4z3p6vbz5jkgc75lk64fci7kieul65o6hk6xznx7lctkmq`
value was logged in the responseâ€”this is the blake3 hash of the data. Hashes uniquely identify the
data's contents, so you can be sure that the data hasn't changed.

### Metadata

You can also add metadata to the object. This is optional, but it can be useful for storing
information about the data you're storing.

```sh
recall bucket add \
--address 0xff0000000000000000000000000000000000008f \
--key "hello/world" \
--metadata "name=hello" \
~/data/hello.txt
```

It's also possible to update an object's metadata after it's been stored.

```sh
recall bucket update \
--address 0xff0000000000000000000000000000000000008f \
--key "hello/world" \
--metadata "foo=bar"
```

<Callout type="info">

All Recall tools (CLI, SDKs, etc.) attempt to infer the data type and automatically attach the
`content-type` metadata, which falls back to `application/octet-stream`. For example, if you pass a
`png` file, it will be inferred as `image/png`.

</Callout>

## Reading data

To read data from a bucket, you can use the `recall bucket get` command by providing the bucket
address and desired key:

```sh
recall bucket get \
--address 0xff0000000000000000000000000000000000008f \
--key "hello/world"
```

The contents are returned in terms of its original size and format.

```
hello
```

The download speed will depend on both your connection speed and the validator's connection speed.
Recall has [high requirements](/protocol/operators) for the hardware and bandwidth of the validator
nodes, so you can expect fast downloads.

Alternatively, if you simply want to see which objects are available for download, the `query`
command can be used:

```sh
recall query \
--address 0xff0000000000000000000000000000000000008f
```

This will return a list of all the objects in the bucket, along with their size and hash.

```json
{
  "objects": [
    {
      "key": "hello/world",
      "value": {
        "hash": "rzghyg4z3p6vbz5jkgc75lk64fci7kieul65o6hk6xznx7lctkmq",
        "size": 6,
        "metadata": {
          "name": "hello",
          "foo": "bar",
          "content-type": "application/octet-stream"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "common_prefixes": [],
  "next_key": null
}
```
