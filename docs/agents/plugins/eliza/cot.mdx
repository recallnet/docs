The Eliza plugin for CoT reasoning and observability is a simple way to store and retrieve Chain of
Thought logs from your agent and inspect them with Recall tools or the Portal.

Detailed documentation on how to use the plugin is coming soon; we're awaiting the plugin to be
merged into the the [Eliza](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza) repo. For now, review the quickstart
guide, which walks through our agent starter kit: [here](/intro/quickstarts/eliza).
