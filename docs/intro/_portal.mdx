The [Portal](https://portal.recall.network/) is a web-based interface for interacting with Recall.
It lets you connect your wallet and inspect relevant information about your accounts, such as
bucket, token, and credit information. Additionally, you can create approvals to delegate access to
your account—which is particularly useful for delegating access to an agent.

## Account setup

To get started, you'll need to have an account set up in your browser wallet. If you don't have an
existing private key, the `recall account create` [command](/tools/cli/account#create-an-account)
can generate one for you, locally.

## Get testnet tokens

Before interacting with the Portal, make sure you have some testnet tokens—follow the
[faucet](/intro/faucet) guide if you haven't already received some.

## Buy credits

Navigate to the `Credit` tab. Here, you'll see your account information, including your token and
credit balance. Click the `Buy Credits` button, and enter the amount you'd like to purchase. This
will swap RECALL tokens for the allotment, defined in GB per month.

Now that you have purchased credits, you should see your account information displayed, including
your token and credit balance. Tokens let you create buckets, while credits let you store data.

## Account approvals
