## `recall account`

Interaction with the Recall network requires an account (ECDSA, secp256k1). As with any blockchain
system, an account can be created at will, transfer funds, and send transactions. A transaction can
be a `deposit`, `withdrawal`, or (intra-subnet) `transfer`.

The `account` command allows you to execute various subcommands:

- `create`: Create a new account with a private key.
- `credit <subcommand>`: Manage credits for your account and sponsoring storage for contracts.
- `info`: Get account information (address, sequence, balance).
- `deposit`: Deposit funds into a subnet from its parent.
- `withdraw`: Withdraw funds from a subnet to its parent.
- `sponsor`: Set or unset an account's default credit sponsor for gas fees.
- `transfer`: Transfer funds to another account in a subnet.

## Create an account

Create a new account from a random seed.

```sh
recall account create
```

This command logs a JSON object to stdout with three properties: the private key, EVM public key,
and its corresponding Wasm compatible address.

**Examples:**

Create a new private key:

```sh
recall account create
```

```json
{
  "private_key": "d5020dd0b12d4d8d8793ff0edbaa29bd7197879ddf82d475b7e9a6a34de765b0",
  "address": "0xc37ab532c1409900520a92e04a6c0482394d3133",
  "fvm_address": "t410fyn5lkmwbicmqauqkslqeu3aeqi4u2mjturajlui"
}
```

Optionally, pipe its output into a file to store the keys:

```sh
recall account create > account.json
```

## Credit

Manage credits for your account and sponsoring storage for contracts.

```sh
recall account credit <SUBCOMMAND>
```

### Buy credit

Buy credits for an account.

```sh
recall account credit buy <AMOUNT>
```

| `--gas-limit`          | No        | Gas limit for the transaction.                                                        |
| `--gas-fee-cap`        | No        | Maximum gas fee for the transaction in attoFIL (1FIL = 10\*\*18 attoFIL).             |
| `--gas-premium`        | No        | Gas premium for the transaction in attoFIL (1FIL = 10\*\*18 attoFIL).                 |
| `--sequence`           | No        | Sequence (i.e., nonce) for the transaction.                                           |

You'll see three values in the `data` field of the response:

- `credit_free`: The number of credits available to spendâ€”equivalent to the amount of credits
  purchased and not yet committed to storing data.
- `credit_committed`: The number of credits committed to storing data.
- `last_debit_epoch`: The epoch (block height) at which the account last had credits debited.

**Examples:**

Buy credit with 1 native coins (displayed with $10^{18}$ units).

```sh
recall account credit buy 1
```

### Get credit stats

Get the credit stats for a subnet.

```sh
recall account credit stats
```

This is more of a subnet-wide view, as opposed to an account-specific view. It's helpful because it
shows the total number of credits sold and committed, number of accounts that have bought credits,
and the credit debit rate.

## Deposit funds

Deposit funds into a subnet from its parent.

```sh
recall account deposit [--to <TO>] <AMOUNT>
```

Think of the `deposit` command as transferring funds from a parent to a child subnet. If you want to
build on Recall, you start by moving funds from the parent L1 (rootnet) to the Recall subnet. This
goes through a smart contract (i.e., the gateway contract) call that locks the funds in a smart
contract on the parent, later minting them to the address on the subnet (i.e., a bridging flow).

| Positionals | Description             |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| `<AMOUNT>`  | The amount to transfer. |

Optionally, you can pass the `--to` flag to deposit funds from the parent to a specific address on
the child. If you don't specify anything, the funds will be deposited to the address corresponding
to the provided private key. Note that the global `--network` flag (defaults to `testnet`) will set
all of the `--evm-...` presets for you, but you _can_ override them with your own values, if needed.

| ---------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-p, --private-key`    | Yes       | Wallet private key (ECDSA, secp256k1) for signing transactions.                   |

| `--evm-rpc-timeout`    | No        | Timeout for calls to the Ethereum API (default: `60 seconds`).                    |
| `--evm-rpc-auth-token` | No        | Bearer token for any Authorization header.                                        |
| `--evm-gateway`        | No        | The gateway contract address.                                                     |
| `--evm-registry`       | No        | The registry contract address.                                                    |

Deposit funds to another address:

```sh
recall account deposit --to 0x15d34aaf54267db7d7c367839aaf71a00a2c6a65 10
```

## Withdraw funds

Withdraw funds from a subnet to its parent.

```sh
recall account withdraw [--to <TO>] <AMOUNT>
```

The `withdraw` command is the opposite of a `deposit`. It moves funds from a subnet to its parent,
which happens through a smart contract call that unlocks the funds in the smart contract on the
parent. Note that the global `--network` flag (defaults to `testnet`) will set all of the
`--evm-...` presets for you, but you _can_ override them with your own values, if needed.

| Positionals | Description             |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| `<AMOUNT>`  | The amount to transfer. |

Similarly, you can pass the `--to` flag to withdraw subnet funds to a specific address on the
parent, but if you don't, the funds will be withdrawn to the address corresponding to the provided
private key.

| Flag                   | Required? | Description                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-p, --private-key`    | Yes       | Wallet private key (ECDSA, secp256k1) for signing transactions.                   |
| `--to <TO>`            | No        | The recipient account address (if not present, defaults to the signer's address). |
| `--evm-rpc-url`        | No        | The Ethereum API RPC HTTP endpoint.                                               |
| `--evm-rpc-timeout`    | No        | Timeout for calls to the Ethereum API (default: `60 seconds`).                    |
| `--evm-rpc-auth-token` | No        | Bearer token for any Authorization header.                                        |
| `--evm-gateway`        | No        | The gateway contract address.                                                     |
| `--evm-registry`       | No        | The registry contract address.                                                    |

**Examples:**

Withdraw funds to the signer's address:

```sh
recall account withdraw 10
```

```json

  "logsBloom": "0x00...",
  "type": "0x2",
  "effectiveGasPrice": "0x0"
}
```

Withdraw funds to another address:

```sh
recall account withdraw --to 0x90f79bf6eb2c4f870365e785982e1f101e93b906 10
```

## Sponsor

Set or unset an account's default credit sponsor for gas fees. This assumes the sponsor has approved
your account via a credit approval.

```sh
recall account sponsor <SUBCOMMAND>
```

| Subcommand | Description                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `set`      | Set an account's default credit sponsor for gas fees.   |
| `unset`    | Unset an account's default credit sponsor for gas fees. |

In each command, it takes the following positionals:

| Positionals | Description             |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| `<SPONSOR>` | Credit sponsor address. |

**Examples:**

Both of these examples presume the account `0x15d34aaf54267db7d7c367839aaf71a00a2c6a65` has executed
a [credit approval](#approve-credit) for your account.

Set an account's default credit sponsor for gas fees.

```sh
recall account sponsor set 0x15d34aaf54267db7d7c367839aaf71a00a2c6a65
```

Unset an account's default credit sponsor for gas fees.

```sh
recall account sponsor unset 0x15d34aaf54267db7d7c367839aaf71a00a2c6a65
```

## Transfer funds

Transfer funds to another account within a subnet.

```sh
recall account transfer --to <TO> <AMOUNT>
```

| Positionals | Description             |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| `<AMOUNT>`  | The amount to transfer. |

The `--to` flag is the destination address within the subnet that you want to send funds to. Note
that the global `--network` flag (defaults to `testnet`) will set all of the `--evm-...` presets for
you, but you _can_ override them with your own values, if needed. This transaction happens fully
_within_ the subnet (and does not interact with the rootnet).

| Flag                   | Required? | Description                                                     |
| ---------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-p, --private-key`    | Yes       | Wallet private key (ECDSA, secp256k1) for signing transactions. |
| `--to <TO>`            | Yes       | The recipient account address.                                  |
| `--evm-rpc-url`        | No        | The Ethereum API RPC HTTP endpoint.                             |
| `--evm-rpc-timeout`    | No        | Timeout for calls to the Ethereum API (default: `60 seconds`).  |
| `--evm-rpc-auth-token` | No        | Bearer token for any Authorization header.                      |
| `--evm-gateway`        | No        | The gateway contract address.                                   |
| `--evm-registry`       | No        | The registry contract address.                                  |

**Examples:**

```sh

<Callout type="info">

When you `transfer` funds from an account that already exists on the subnet to an account that
doesn't exist, the recipient will effectively be created. Thus, it's much faster (a couple of
seconds) than a `deposit` or `withdraw`, which require a two-step process that eventually settles on
the rootnet.
