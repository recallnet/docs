## `recall timehub`

Timehubs are an anchoring service, separate from Basin. You can interact with a timehub contract
using either the `timehub` or aliased `th` subcommand:

```sh
recall timehub <SUBCOMMAND>
recall th <SUBCOMMAND>
```

The `timehub` subcommand has the following subcommands:

- `create`: Create a new timehub.
- `list`: List timehubs.
- `push`: Push a value.
- `leaf`: Get leaf at a given index and height.
- `count`: Get leaf count at a given height.
- `peaks`: Get peaks at a given height.
- `root`: Get root at a given height.
- `help`: Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s).

The timehub usage is a work in progress and will be updated in the future. It's fully functional, so
feel free to follow the commands above as desired.
