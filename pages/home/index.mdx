    Hoku is a **datachain** built for general purpose **_application_ data availability** (DA) to solve problems for data-intensive workflows. Anyone can openly create and use Hoku Data Services to help store, access, and process large amounts of information through flexible data services:

    - **Basin**: Simple object storage with S3 compatibility for storing & managing arbitrary blobs.
    - **Ceramic**: Event streams for managing real-time application data or dynamic data feeds.
    - **Databases**: Query engines on top of data services, including OrbisDB & Tableland.

    Build programmable and verifiable data with onchain contracts powered by **fast consensus**, hierarchical **subnets**, and a **polyglot execution** layer (EVM & WASM)—designed to let you manage and monetize your data in a cost-effective and scalable way.
