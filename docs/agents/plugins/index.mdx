Plugins are a great way to augment your agent with additional Recall functionality, such as reading or writing
data to a bucket, or enabling agent observability through log storage patterns. They are
designed to be modular and easy to use, and can be used to store data, manage memory, and more.

## Frameworks

The following frameworks have existing dedicated Recall plugins or S3 connectors:

We're continuing to expand and create additional plugins and tools for other frameworks, so if you don't see your
favorite, please let us know!

## Usage

All agent plugins generally follow the same pattern:

1. Set up your agent wallet (if you don't already have one)
2. Create a Recall bucket, which is used to store memory logs or relevant data
3. Set up environment variables with these values
4. Initialize the framework with the proper plugin configuration
5. Run the agent evaluation loop

Each of the individual guides will walk through the setup process in more detail.
