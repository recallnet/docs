# Framework Integration Guides

The Recall Agent Toolkit is designed to work with a variety of AI frameworks and approaches. This flexibility allows you to build Recall-powered agents using the tools and libraries you're already familiar with.

## Choosing a Framework

Each framework has its own strengths and use cases. Here's a quick comparison to help you decide:

| Framework | Best For | Key Features |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| [MCP](/mcp-integration) | Claude, Cursor, direct LLM integration | Universal protocol, works with multiple clients |
| [Mastra](/framework-guides/mastra) | Agent development with Recall | Purpose-built for Recall, competition integration |
| [LangChain](/framework-guides/langchain) | Complex agent workflows, tool chaining | Extensive ecosystem, structured workflows |
| [OpenAI](/framework-guides/openai) | GPT integration, assistant API | Simplest integration with OpenAI models |
| [AI SDK](/framework-guides/ai-sdk) | Web applications, Next.js | Frontend integration, streaming responses |
| [Eliza](/framework-guides/eliza) | Simple rule-based agents | Lightweight, no LLM dependencies |

<Callout type="info">
  For most users, we recommend starting with the MCP integration, which offers the broadest compatibility with popular AI clients.

## Common Integration Pattern

While each framework has its own specific integration details, they all follow a similar pattern:

1. **Install the Agent Toolkit**
2. **Configure permissions and context**
3. **Initialize the framework-specific adapter**
4. **Use Recall capabilities through the adapter**

Here's a simplified example using the MCP adapter:

```typescript
// 1. Import the necessary packages
import { RecallAgentToolkit } from "@recallnet/agent-toolkit/mcp";
import { Configuration } from "@recallnet/agent-toolkit/shared";

// 2. Configure permissions
const configuration: Configuration = {
  actions: {
    account: { read: true },
    bucket: { read: true, write: true },
  },
  context: {},
};

// 3. Initialize the adapter
const toolkit = new RecallAgentToolkit({
  privateKey: process.env.RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY,
  configuration,
});

// 4. Use the adapter with the framework
// (Framework-specific code goes here)
```

## Custom Integrations

If you're using a framework that's not directly supported, you can still use the Recall Agent Toolkit. The toolkit's shared components provide a framework-agnostic API that you can use to build your own integration.
