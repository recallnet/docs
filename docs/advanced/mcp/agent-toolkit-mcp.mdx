description: Using the Model Context Protocol with the Agent Toolkit
---

The Recall Agent Toolkit provides a powerful MCP implementation that gives your agents access to the
full range of Recall's capabilities. This guide provides a deeper look at the Agent Toolkit MCP
integration, focusing on advanced usage, configuration options, and best practices.

## Understanding the `RecallAgentToolkit`

The `RecallAgentToolkit` class is the core of the MCP integration. It:

1. Manages authentication with Recall
2. Controls permissions for various operations
3. Exposes Recall tools in MCP-compatible format
4. Handles the conversion between MCP tool calls and Recall API calls

```typescript
import { RecallAgentToolkit } from "@recallnet/agent-toolkit/mcp";

const toolkit = new RecallAgentToolkit({
  privateKey: process.env.RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY,
  configuration: {
    actions: {
      account: { read: true, write: true }, // Read and write account information
      bucket: { read: true, write: true }, // Read and write bucket information
    },
    context: {
      network: "testnet", // Optional network configuration
    },
  },
});
```

## Available tools

The Agent Toolkit MCP integration provides the following tool categories:

### Bucket management

Tools for creating and managing buckets:

- `create_bucket` - Create a new storage bucket
- `get_or_create_bucket` - Get or create a new storage bucket
- `list_buckets` - List all buckets owned by the agent

### Object management

Tools for storing and retrieving data within buckets:

- `add_object` - Store a value in a bucket with a specified key
- `get_object` - Retrieve a value from a bucket using its key
- `query_objects` - Query objects in a bucket
- `delete_object` - Delete an object from a bucket

### Account information

Tools for managing the agent's account:

- `get_account_info` - Get account information
- `get_credit_info` - Get the amount of credits available

## Detailed configuration options

The `RecallAgentToolkit` constructor accepts various configuration options:

- `privateKey`: The private key for the agent
- `configuration`: The configuration for the agent with permissions and context

### Configuring permissions

The configuration object allows fine-grained control over what actions the agent can perform:

```typescript
type Configuration = {
  actions: {
    account?: {
      read?: boolean;
    };
    bucket?: {
      read?: boolean;
      write?: boolean;
    };
  };
  context?: {
    network?: string;
    [key: string]: unknown;
  };
};
```

Always follow the principle of least privilege. Only grant the permissions your agent actually
needs.

</Callout>

## Setting up MCP with different transport types

The Agent Toolkit supports different MCP transport mechanisms:

### Standard input/output

Good for Cursor, Claude, and other MCP clients:

```typescript title="index.ts"
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";

const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await toolkit.connect(transport);
```

### HTTP server transport

Good for web-based integrations or remote access:

```typescript title="index.ts"
import { HttpServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/http.js";

const transport = new HttpServerTransport({
  port: 8000,
  host: "localhost",
});
await toolkit.connect(transport);
```

## Production best practices

### Error handling

Always implement robust error handling:

```typescript title="index.ts"
try {
  await toolkit.connect(transport);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Failed to connect toolkit:", error);
  // Implement proper error handling here
  process.exit(1);
}
```

### Security considerations

1. **Environment variables**: Store private keys in environment variables
2. **Access control**: Use strict file permissions for .env files
3. **Permission scoping**: Only grant necessary permissions
4. **Rate limiting**: Implement rate limiting for high-volume applications
5. **Input validation**: Validate inputs before passing to tools

## Testing MCP integration

MCP comes with a built-in debugging tool that allows you to test your agent's tools before
connecting to the Recall network. After you set up your MCP server, you can start the inspector
with:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector tsx index.ts
```

## System prompts for MCP

Effective system prompts help your MCP-powered agent understand how to use Recall tools:

```
You are an agent with access to Recall tools through the Model Context Protocol.
You can use these tools to store and retrieve data, work with verifiable sources,
and manage your account.

Available tools:
- get_or_create_bucket: Create or access a storage bucket
- list_buckets: List all buckets
- add_object: Store data in a bucket
- get_object: Retrieve data from a bucket
- query_objects: Query objects in a bucket
- delete_object: Delete an object from a bucket

When storing information, create organized bucket structures with logical naming.
Always check if data exists before trying to retrieve it.
```
