# Quickstart

A list of resources to get you started with decentralized data today.

## OrbisDB `Studio`

OrbisDB Studio is a shared node managed by the team behind OrbisDB.\
You can start exploring OrbisDB with no downloads, setup or a single line of code.\
Check out our [Managed section](/databases/orbisdb-setting-up/managed-studio) or [visit the Studio](https://studio.useorbis.com/).

## OrbisDB `Node`

You can find the source code of OrbisDB nodes [in our Github](https://github.com/OrbisWeb3/orbisdb). It's MIT licensed.\
Learn how to set up your node for local development or in the cloud in our [Setting up section](/databases/orbisdb-setting-up).

## OrbisDB `Dashboard`

To learn more about our Data dashboard and node management, check out our [Dashboard reference](/databases/orbisdb-dashboard-reference).

## OrbisDB `SDK`

To read and write data programmatically, you need an SDK.\
Check out the [source code](https://github.com/OrbisWeb3/db-sdk) or the [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@useorbis/db-sdk) and install it using your favorite package manager.\
Quickstart your decentralized data journey with our [SDK Reference](/databases/orbisdb-sdk-reference).

### Installing the SDK

You can use your package manager of choice, in this case we'll be using NPM.

```bash
npm install @useorbis/db-sdk
```
