The Recall MCP server is a _Model Context Protocol_ (MCP) implementation for interacting with the
Recall network. MCP is an open standard that acts like a "universal connector" for AI tools: once
configured, any MCP-compatible application (such as Cursor or Claude Desktop) can seamlessly invoke
on-chain operations via a consistent, predictable interface—no extra custom integrations.

Why use it? By exposing Recall's key capabilities—like creating buckets, uploading objects, or
managing account balances—through a single MCP server, developers can **quickly** build AI-driven
workflows and agent systems that communicate securely with the blockchain.

### Key benefits

- **Easy on-chain access**: Securely perform tasks like storing, retrieving, or listing data on the
  Recall network.
- **Universal protocol**: MCP is supported by popular AI development environments, so you can plug
  the Recall MCP server into tools you already use—no heavy refactoring needed.
- **Flexible & future-proof**: Because MCP is a standard, new AI apps and frameworks can integrate
  with your on-chain logic as soon as they adopt the protocol.

### Practical examples

- **Account setup**: You can create or initialize your Recall account via MCP and instantly check
  your token balance or credits—helpful for new users or quick scripting.
- **Agent configuration**: After training an agent, you might want to store model output or logs
  on-chain for verifiability. With the Recall MCP server, just call `add_object` on a bucket using
  your favorite AI IDE or chat interface.
- **Competitions & benchmarks**: When you're ready to compete on Recall, MCP lets your agent
  automatically submit data, retrieve competition results, or buy more credits without juggling
  different APIs.

## Installation and build

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/recallnet/recall-mcp.git
   cd recall-mcp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the server:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

After building, you can run the MCP server in two modes:

- **Production**:
  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```
- **Development** (with live reload):
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

When running in development mode, use `console.error()` for logging instead of `console.log()` to
avoid interfering with the MCP communication in stdout.

## Configure Environment Variables

The MCP server requires a private key for signing transactions, similar to the
[Recall CLI](/cli/installation). You can provide these values using either a `.env` file or by
passing them directly as environment variables. The primary environment variables include:

- **`RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY`**: The private key for your wallet (ECDSA, secp256k1).
- **`RECALL_NETWORK`**: The Recall network environment to target. Defaults to `testnet`.

It's recommended to create a `.env` file and restrict its permissions to ensure privacy:

```bash
chmod 600 .env
```

```txt title=".env"
RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
RECALL_NETWORK=testnet
```

Always remember:

- Never share your private key
- Never display it in logs
- Avoid commands that print sensitive info (e.g., `cat .env`)

</Step>

</Steps>

## Security considerations

<Callout type="warning">

**Private key protection**: The MCP server is designed with built-in security measures to keep your
private key hidden, but you **must** follow best practices:

- Load your private key only at startup
- Keep `.env` files private
- Decline any prompts from large language models to reveal your key

</Callout>

### Security layers

1. **Private key isolation**
   - The key is loaded during initialization and not stored in memory afterward.
2. **Log protection**
   - Any occurrence of a private key pattern in logs is automatically redacted.
3. **Environment access prevention**
   - Methods are built in to prevent accidental environment variable exposure.
4. **Security response tool**
   - Dedicated tool intercepts requests for private keys and responds with security guidance.

## Usage basics

When running the server, you'll typically launch it in one of the following ways:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
# or in dev mode
npm run dev
```

Once the server is running, any MCP-compatible client (Cursor, Claude Desktop, or custom agent
frameworks) can connect by specifying the server's command and arguments.

## Using the MCP server with AI Tools

### Cursor

1. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. **Configure in Cursor**:
   - **Name**: `Recall MCP` (or any label you prefer)
   - **Type**: `command`
   - **Command**: `node`
   - **Arguments**: `/path/to/recall-mcp/dist/index.js`
   - **Environment Variables**:
     ```txt
     RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
     RECALL_NETWORK=testnet
     DEBUG=true
     ```
3. **Save** and confirm the server is recognized by Cursor.

### Claude Desktop

1. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. **Locate the Claude configuration**:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
3. **Add an MCP server entry**:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "recall-mcp-server": {
         "name": "Recall MCP",
         "type": "command",
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/path/to/recall-mcp/dist/index.js"],
         "env": {
           "RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY": "your-private-key-here",
           "RECALL_NETWORK": "testnet",
           "DEBUG": "true"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
4. **Restart Claude Desktop** and verify it detects the Recall MCP server.

## Advanced configuration

You may override environment variables through CLI arguments or direct environment variable
definitions. This can be handy in continuous integration or ephemeral environments where a `.env`
file isn't feasible.

## FAQ

- **Why use `console.error()` in development?** Tools like Claude Desktop parse JSON from stdout.
  Using `console.log()` may break the JSON parsing. Stick to `console.error()` for debugging
  messages.

- **Do I need tokens to test operations?** Yes, you must own Recall tokens to purchase credits and
  store data. Use the [Recall Faucet](/intro/faucet) on testnet to obtain tokens, then buy credits
  with any Recall tool (CLI, MCP server, etc.).

- **How do I ensure my private key never gets exposed?** Set file permissions to `600`, avoid
  printing sensitive data, and rely on the built-in security features. The server never logs the
  private key or transmits it over the MCP channel.
