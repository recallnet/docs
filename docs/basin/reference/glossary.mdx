## CID

A [CID](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/) is short for _Content Identifier_,
which is a self-describing, content-addressed, and immutable hash determined by the contents itself.
For example, a CID might look something like
`bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi`.

## Wasm contract

A Wasm contract is an FVM-specific smart contract—also called "actor"—that is used to store and
manage data on Recall. These have more flexible and data-oriented programmatic control since they
are often written in Rust.

## Detached payload

A piece of data that is stored in Basin with an asynchronous sync mechanism, which is a transaction
that includes a blake3 hash reference to an object, but does not include the object data itself.

## EVM

The [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) (EVM) is the stack
machine that is used to execute smart contracts on the Ethereum network. It can access the state of
the Ethereum network, including accounts, and run arbitrary code.

## FVM

The [Filecoin Virtual Machine](https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/fundamentals/the-fvm) (FVM)
is a WebAssembly-based virtual machine that is used to execute smart contracts on the Filecoin
network. Its access patterns and terminology differ from the EVM, but it has full EVM compatibility
by way of the FEVM runtime on the FVM.

## Smart contract

A smart contract is a "traditional" EVM contract, most commonly written in Solidity. It exposes
EVM-specific types, state access, and functionality.

## Subnet

Subnets are smaller, more manageable networks that are are "rooted" on a base chain (Filecoin) and
operate under their own consensus rules. Basin currently runs on a single subnet, which gives it
high data throughput and fast finality.

In the future, Basin will support multiple subnets, which will allow for more flexibility and
decentralization. For example, there could be subnets on top of subnets, each with their own
consensus rules.
