<Steps>

<Step>

### Run the adapter

Start the adapter with the binary installed and flags described in the
[installation](/basin/s3/installation) page.

```sh
basin_s3 --private-key [your_private_key] --access-key AKEXAMPLES3S --secret-key SKEXAMPLES3S
```

This will start the adapter on port `8014` by default. Also, recall the `--network` flag can,
optionally, be provided to point to a specific Recall chain environment, and logging can be enabled
by passing the `-v` flag.

</Step>

<Step>

### Install boto3

Assuming you already have a Python environment, install boto3:

<Tabs items={["pip", "uv"]}>
  <Tab value="pip">pip install boto3</Tab>
  <Tab value="uv">uv pip install boto3</Tab>
</Tabs>

</Step>

<Step>

### Create helper functions

#### Create a connection

First, we'll import the necessary modules and define a helper function to connect to the adapter:

```python
from boto3 import client as S3Client, session as S3Session
from botocore.config import Config
from botocore.exceptions import NoCredentialsError, PartialCredentialsError

# Establish a connection to the Basin S3 adapter
def connect_to_basin(host: str, access_key: str, secret_key: str) -> S3Client:
    try:
        # Create a session and S3 client
        session = S3Session.Session()
        basin = session.client(
            "s3",
            endpoint_url=host,
            aws_access_key_id=access_key,
            aws_secret_access_key=secret_key,
            config=Config(
                retries={"max_attempts": 3},
                s3={"addressing_style": "path"},
            ),
        )
        return basin
    except (NoCredentialsError, PartialCredentialsError, Exception) as e:
        print(f"Failed to connect to Basin: {str(e)}")
        raise
```

#### Create a bucket

Our bucket creation helper does one important thing: it prefixes the bucket name with the creator's
public key. This is important because the adapter has a slight workaround to work with Basin. Any
time you create a bucket with the S3 adapter, you'll initially define the name as something like
`my-bucket`. The actual onchain representation stores this as an alias with the bucket's metadata.
Then, when interacting with a bucket, you'll use the `<owner_address>.<bucket_name>` as the bucket
name.

```python
# Create a bucket in Basin
def create_bucket(client: S3Client, bucket_name: str, owner_address: str) -> str | None:
    try:
        # Create a bucket (the name doesn't matter)
        client.create_bucket(Bucket=bucket_name)
        buckets = client.list_buckets()
        # Find the bucket with matching name
        matching_bucket = next(
            (
                bucket["Name"]
                for bucket in buckets["Buckets"]
                if bucket["Name"] == bucket_name
            ),
            None,
        )
        if matching_bucket:
            # Alter the `Name` property to prefix the name: `<owner_address>.<bucket_name>`
            prefixed_name = f"{owner_address}.{bucket_name}"
            return prefixed_name
        else:
            print(f"Could not find bucket with name: {bucket_name}")
            return None
    except (NoCredentialsError, PartialCredentialsError, Exception) as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while creating a bucket: {e}")
        return None
```

#### Interact with objects

The following functions interact with objects in the store, including writing, listing, and getting
objects.

```python
# Write an object to the store under the given key with a value
def write_object(client: S3Client, bucket: str, key: str, value: str) -> None:
    try:
        client.put_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key, Body=value)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while writing data: {e}")


# List objects in the store, optionally, with a prefix
def list_objects(
    client: S3Client, bucket: str, prefix: str | None = None
) -> list | None:
    options = {"Bucket": bucket}
    if prefix is not None:
        options["Prefix"] = prefix
    try:
        response = client.list_objects(**options)
        if "Contents" in response:
            objects = response["Contents"]
            return objects
        else:
            return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while listing objects: {e}")
        return None


# Get an object from the store by key
def get_object(client: S3Client, bucket: str, key: str) -> str | None:
    try:
        response = client.get_object(
            Bucket=bucket,
            Key=key,
        )
        return response["Body"].read()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while getting object: {e}")
        return None
```

### Connect, write, and read data

The example below demonstrates how to connect to the adapter, create a bucket, and interact with
objects. It establishes a connection, creates a bucket, writes a simple key/value pair, and then
reads it back.

The one callout is the `OWNER_ADDRESS` environment variable.

```python
from os import getenv
from time import sleep

# Import the methods above if in a different file, or use accordingly

# Define your S3 adapter connection details
host = getenv("S3_HOST") or "http://localhost:8014"
access_key = getenv("S3_ACCESS_KEY") or "S3EXAMPLEAK"
secret_key = getenv("S3_SECRET_KEY") or "S3EXAMPLESK"
# Note: below is the public key of a localnet account with private key:
# 7c852118294e51e653712a81e05800f419141751be58f605c371e15141b007a6
owner_address = (
    getenv("OWNER_ADDRESS") or "0x90f79bf6eb2c4f870365e785982e1f101e93b906"
)

# Connect to the Basin S3 adapter
basin = connect_to_basin(host, access_key, secret_key)
if basin is None:
    raise RuntimeError("Failed to connect to Basin")

# Create a bucket
bucket = create_bucket(basin, "my-bucket", owner_address)
if bucket is None:
    raise RuntimeError("Failed to create bucket")
print(f"Bucket created successfully: {bucket}")

# Write an object under the `hello/world` key
key_prefix = "hello"
key = f"{key_prefix}/world"
write_object(basin, bucket, key, b"hello")
print(f"Uploaded file to Basin at key: {key}")

print("Waiting for transaction to settle...")
sleep(3)

# List objects
objects = list_objects(basin, bucket, f"{key_prefix}/")
if not objects:
    print("No objects found after upload")
    return

# Get an object from the list
object_key = objects[0]["Key"]
object_data = get_object(basin, bucket, object_key)
if object_data:
    print(f"Retrieved object: {object_data}")
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve object")
```

</Step>
