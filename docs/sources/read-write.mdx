Once you've created a data source, you have full control over it. By default, only the owner of a
bucket can write to it, but _anyone_ can read from it if they know the contract address.

## Writing data

To write data to a bucket, you can use the `recall bucket add` command. Executing the write
operation will send the data to the network in two steps:

1. Stage the data with the validator whose RPCs / APIs it is calling
2. Finalize the data onchain with a transaction, which creates the key-value mapping in the bucket

```
> recall bucket add \
--address 0xff0000000000000000000000000000000000008f \
--key "hello/world" \
~/data/hello.txt

Added object in 1 second (hash=rzghyg4z3p6vbz5jkgc75lk64fci7kieul65o6hk6xznx7lctkmq; size=6)
```

Sending the data should only take a second or two, and then the data will be available to read from
the bucket immediately. You'll notice the `rzghyg4z3p6vbz5jkgc75lk64fci7kieul65o6hk6xznx7lctkmq`
value was logged in the responseâ€”this is the blake3 hash of the data.

## Reading data

To read data from a bucket, you can use the `recall bucket get` command by providing the bucket
address and desired key:

```
> recall bucket get \
--address 0xff0000000000000000000000000000000000008f \
--key "hello/world"

hello
```

The download speed will depend on both your connection speed and the validator's connection speed.
Recall has [high requirements](/protocol/operators) for the hardware and bandwidth of the validator
nodes, so you can expect fast downloads.
