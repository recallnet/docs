The `recall_s3` binary is a simple adapter that allows you to use the Recall object storage system
with S3 APIs. Let's walk through how to set it up, and subsequent pages walk through how to use it
with ancillary tools like MinIO.

### Setup

<Steps>

<Step>

### Install

First, clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/recallnet/recall-s3
```

Then, `cd` into `recall-s3` and install the adapter binary:

```sh
make install
```

This should make `recall_s3` available in your path, which you can verify with
`recall_s3 --version`. Alternatively, if you don't want to install it, you can run it directly with
`cargo run` in the subsequent step.

<Callout type="warning">

**You MUST own tokens and credits** to create a bucket and store data, respectively. The
[Recall Faucet](/intro/faucet) will send you testnet tokens, which you can use to purchase credits
with any of the Recall tools (SDK, CLI, etc.). The [Recall Portal](/intro/portal), for example,
makes it easy to manage credits and tokens instead of handling it programmatically.

### Run the adapter

Starting the Recall S3 adapter uses port `8014` by default. There are three required flags if you're
doing write operations:

| Flag            | Required | Description                                                                                                                |
| --------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--private-key` | Yes      | Hex encoded, Ethereum-style private key (ECDSA, secp256k1) for sending transactions (environment variable: `PRIVATE_KEY`). |
| `--access-key`  | Yes      | An S3 access key (e.g,. `AKEXAMPLES3S`)                                                                                    |
| `--secret-key`  | Yes      | An S3 secret key (e.g., `SKEXAMPLES3S`)                                                                                    |
| `--network`     | No       | The network to connect to (defaults to testnet; environment variable: `NETWORK`).                                          |

```sh
recall_s3 \
--private-key [your_private_key] \
--access-key AKEXAMPLES3S \
--secret-key SKEXAMPLES3S
```

The access key and secret aren't used for anything other than matching the MinIO client
configuration. If you want to do read-only queries, simply omit the private key.

```sh
recall_s3 \
--access-key AKEXAMPLES3S \
--secret-key SKEXAMPLES3S
```

Note that if you didn't install the binary in the previous step, you can run it directly with
`cargo run --features binary -- ...` and the arguments above.

<Callout type="info">

If you do not already have a private key, you can generate one with the Recall CLI. You also _must_
make sure your account exists on the subnet, which requires you to have deposited funds into your
subnet account. Neglecting this step will lead to errors like
`failed to init sequence; actor ... cannot be found`.

<Step>

### Create an aliased bucket

Bucket usage _slightly_ deviates from how you typically would in S3. The S3 adapter uses the `alias`
key **stored in the bucket's metadata** to identify the bucket name and its relationship with other
onchain buckets owned by the creator.

Under the hood, the general naming convention is `<0x_address>.<bucket_name>`. For example, if you
create a bucket called `foo`, the bucket name interpreted by the adapter will be
`0x90f79bf6eb2c4f870365e785982e1f101e93b906.foo`.

There are two common patterns when you specify a bucket name for usage with the S3 adapter:

1. **Expanded**: Use the aliased name prefixed by the creator's public key (i.e., EVM hex address),
   delimited by a period—e.g., `0x90f79bf6eb2c4f870365e785982e1f101e93b906.foo`.
2. **Aliased**: Use only the aliased name as the bucket name—e.g., `foo`.

<Callout type="warn">

The S3 API prohibits bucket names from being longer than 63 characters: here. Since a hex address is
42 characters, it leaves **20 characters for the _aliased_ bucket name** (since _actual_ buckets are
defined as `<hex_address>.<name>` with a period in between).

</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

### Read or write to S3

If you're reading/writing to buckets you've created, you'll typically just use the aliased name as
the bucket name. You _can_ opt for the expanded format, if desired, but the adapter will try to use
the address of the provided private key as the owner of the bucket—unless explicitly overridden.
However, if you're interacting with buckets _you don't own_, you **must** use the expanded format
with the aliased name prefixed by the creator's public key.

For example, let's say account `0x90f79bf6eb2c4f870365e785982e1f101e93b906` creates a bucket called
`foo`:

- If `0x90f7...` wants to read or write data, they can simply use `foo`.
- But, if some other account wants to read or write to `foo`, they **must** use the expanded format
  `0x90f79bf6eb2c4f870365e785982e1f101e93b906.foo`.

That is, this pattern can be used for multiwriter buckets, too. If `0x90f7...` makes a credit
approval to account `0x1234...`, the "owner" of the bucket is still `0x90f7...`. If `0x1234...`
wants to _write_ to `foo`, they **must** use the expanded format.

More generally, this is required because the bucket alias is not in a global namespace but only as
part of the bucket's metadata. The adapter needs to know who the bucket's owner is in order to query
the metadata and retrieve the correct bucket.

## Next steps

You can now use Recall with any S3-compatible tooling! There are a few walkthroughs that show how to
use it with ancillary tools like MinIO and Python `boto3`.
