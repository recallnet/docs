## Privileged roles in Recall network

The RECALL token deployments include some "privileged" roles that give certain addresses the ability
to perform specific administrative functions. These roles are secured by multisig wallets to
minimize associated risks. This section describes these roles, what capabilities they have, what
risks they pose, and how those risks are mitigated.

### Recall security council

The Recall Security Council is responsible for pausing token operations in emergency situations.

#### Description

Secured by a 2-of-3 multisig wallet, where all three signers are Recall Labs team members.

#### Capabilities

- Can pause token operations across all networks in emergency situations
- Acts as the Pauser role for all RECALL token deployments

#### Risks

- Compromised Security Council could pause token operations, preventing transfers and other token
  functionality
- Malicious actors could disrupt the network by pausing tokens without valid security reasons

#### Mitigations

- Secured by a 2-of-3 multisig wallet, requiring at least two signers to approve any action
- All three signers are Recall Labs team members who are accountable for their actions
- Pausing is intended only for emergency security situations

#### Security council multisig address

- **Base**:
  [`0x9331C859E03E158Bff8Ee371c636b7e7FC54E9ad`](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=base:0x9331C859E03E158Bff8Ee371c636b7e7FC54E9ad)

### Recall foundation

The Recall Foundation manages contract upgrades and token minting across all networks.

#### Description

Secured by a 3-of-5 multisig wallet, where four signers are independent parties outside the core
team.

#### Capabilities

- Can upgrade token contracts across all networks
- Can mint new RECALL tokens as needed for network operations
- Acts as both the Admin and Minter roles for all RECALL token deployments

#### Risks

- Compromised Foundation could upgrade token contracts to introduce malicious functionality
- Malicious actors could mint arbitrary amounts of RECALL tokens, diluting token holders
- Compromised Foundation could modify contract logic to lock or remove tokens

#### Mitigations

- Secured by a 3-of-5 multisig wallet, requiring at least three signers to approve any action
- Four of the five signers are independent parties outside the core team, providing external
  oversight
- Upgrades and minting operations are subject to multisig approval, preventing unilateral actions

#### Foundation multisig address

- **Base**:
  [`0x05634A50F64F9be0FdEb944a6A5eC40eD1068A60`](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=base:0x05634A50F64F9be0FdEb944a6A5eC40eD1068A60)
