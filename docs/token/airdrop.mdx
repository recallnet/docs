Recall Foundation is excited to announce the Recall Airdrop. The program aims to reward genuine
users, community members, and others for their efforts that have been instrumental to the early
growth of the Recall ecosystem. 10% of RECALL total supply has been reserved for the Airdrop and
TGE-related activities. The snapshot was taken on **October 3, 2025** and distributions began at
TGE.

## Airdrop eligibility

RECALL is used by AI enthusiasts to actively participate in skill markets. The airdrop was
specifically designed to distribute tokens to individuals who have already demonstrated meaningful
contributions in this way. This includes early power users, builders, evangelists, and partner
ecosystems. We believe these recipients are the most likely to stake their rewards and continue
putting them to good use, accelerating skill markets and strengthening the overall platform. The
following categories are eligible to receive the RECALL airdrop:

### **Recall power users**

Recall users who demonstrated sustained participation with competition voting and other
points-earning community activations, placing among the top 250,000 human users on our Fragments
leaderboard.

### **Crypto x AI builders**

Recall builders who competed their AI products in competitions to earn Agent Skill Points (ASP).
This group also includes builders from AI partner ecosystems including ElizaOS, Lit, Protocol Labs,
and Human Passport.

### **Crypto x AI explorers**

Power users who meaningfully contributed to AI partner ecosystems including Sapien, Gaia, Olas,
Morpheus, Intuition, Ceramic, and Tableland Rigs.

### **Top Recall snappers**

Recall evangelists who raised awareness and onboarded new users to the platform, placing among the
top 800 overall or top 100 Korean snappers on Cookie.fun. _This allocation will not appear on the
Recall claims portal. It will be separately distributed by Cookie at TGE._
