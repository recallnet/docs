description: Onchain decentralized SQL database for chain-driven queries.
---

[Tableland](https://tableland.xyz/) is a database built on the SQLite engine, providing developers
with a web3-native, relational database that easily integrates into their stack. With Tableland, you
can:

- Utilize SQL to interact with onchain data, making the development process simpler and more
  efficient.
- Configure row-level access rules driven by wallet addresses, token ownership, account balances,
  and any logic you choose.
- Build robust data pipelines that process and distribute large amounts of data for DePIN, DeSci,
  games, and more, all with smart contracts or SDKs that leverage serverless infra.

  Tableland currently operates independently and is not yet available as part of the Recall network,
  but it will be in the future! In the meantime, you can still use Tableland in its current state
  since the future Recall integration will not affect your existing data. You can learn how to build
  with Tableland: [here](https://docs.tableland.xyz/)
