description: Understand the basics behind Recall's architecture.

Recall is a next-gen blockchain platform designed to support the economies of today's web3 data
producers by providing the infrastructure needed to securely store, verify, and efficiently
distribute novel data. Recall incorporates a programmable data layer to enable complex data
operations directly on the blockchain, integrating onchain smart contracts with offchain data
services to bridge Web2 and Web3. Recall's architecture supports many applications, including
onchain object storage, scalable edge data storage, AI and machine learning applications, IoT data
management, and more.

## Subnets

The network leverages a hierarchical subnet architecture for scalability and efficiency, allowing
validators to participate in multiple subnets with a single stake, thereby optimizing capital
efficiency and reducing barriers to entry. Recall introduces several additional innovations, such as
alpha entanglement coding and a consensus coprocessor framework. These innovations enable Recall to
provide high-throughput, low-latency data ingest and retrieval, and high availability and fault
tolerance, all within in a permission-less and owner-less decentralized network.

## Platform

The Recall blockchain thus provides high-throughput, low-latency data ingest and retrieval, high
availability and fault tolerance, permission-less and owner-less operation, and _direct and
programmatic access_ to data. This means users can access and manipulate stored data directly
through onchain smart contracts, while offchain services provide scalable data storage, retrieval,
and computation. This in turn makes Recall better-suited than other blockchain-based solutions, and
competitive with traditional cloud services in terms of cost, throughput, scalability, usability,
and features.

The three key enablers for this are:

1. **Hierarchical consensus** which allows Recall to scale to millions of users and billions of data
   objects by organizing the network into multiple _subnets_,
2. **Consensus coprocessor** framework that moves expensive computation and data synchronization off
   the blockchain's hotpath, and
3. **Alpha-entangled** blob storage which enables verifiable storage and retrieval of large binary
   blobs.
