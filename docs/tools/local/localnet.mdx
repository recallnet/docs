title: Running the localnet
description: Leverage a Dockerized multi-node setup for development.
---

This page walks through how to spin up a local Recall network with Docker (`localnet`) and presumes
you've done the steps described in the preceding [setup page](/tools/local).

## Overview

The localnet is a three node network that runs in Docker containers. It's a bit intensive to start
up but allows you to quickly iterate and build without relying on the remote testnet. It starts up
all of the services, provides you with prefunded accounts, and can be useful with any of the Recall
developer tooling.

### Docker

All scripts use `cargo make` to start Docker containers, volumes, and a Docker network. Before
getting started, make sure that Docker is running by checking the status of the Docker daemon:

```sh
docker ps
```

If it's not running, start it:

<Tabs items={["macOS", "Linux"]}>

  <Tab value="macOS">

    Make sure the [Docker Desktop app](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) is installed, and then open it.

    ```sh
    open /Applications/Docker.app
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Linux">

    Use `systemctl` to start the daemon.

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl start docker
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Make sure you're currently in the `ipc` repository's root directory (from the previous setup and
installation step). We'll be running the local network from the `scripts` folder.

All scripts use `cargo make` to start docker containers, volumes, and a docker network. You can use
`docker ps` to check the status of each container. Also, you **must** run the scripts from the root
of the repo!

## Startup & shutdown

A localnet deployments will create a subnet with `anvil` as the rootnet (parent). The scripts will
handle localnet validator keys (using the standard `anvil` accounts) and configs in the config
folder (defaults to `~/.ipc`). In the root of the `ipc` repo, you can run the localnet with the
following `Makefile` command:

```shell
make run-localnet
```

If you want to, for example, skip the build and dependency installation steps, you can do so with
the following. Namely, after you build the localnet images for the first time, it's common to skip
the build and dependency steps (unless new changes are made to the `ipc` codebase).

```shell
SKIP_BUILD=true SKIP_DEPENDENCIES=true make run-localnet
```

Lastly, if you're ready to stop the network, you can run the stop script:

```shell
make stop-localnet
```

Also optional is the `recall` CLI, which (if installed) will pre-buy credits for all accounts in the
localnet subnet setup. Follow the instructions in the `rust-recall` repo to install it:
[here](https://github.com/recallnet/rust-recall).

The following outlines general observations for how long the localnet deployment process takes and
various metrics:

- Deploy + build images: ~7 minutes
- Deploy with prebuilt images: ~5 minutes (i.e., `SKIP_BUILD=true`)
- Blocks: ~1 per second
- Topdown messages: ~2 minutes (e.g., depositing funds from the rootnet)
- Bottomup messages: ~15 seconds
- Stopping the network: ~40â€“45 seconds

## Logging

Deploying a network will log various steps and summary information to the console, including the RPC
URLs and contracts. It'll also show the available accounts, private keys, and respective balances.

Once the startup process is complete, each Docker container will also log its own information to the
console.

## Docker containers

Use `docker ps` to list the network's containers. Each validator has six containers, and there are a
few others used across the full network.

You can check a validator's logs with `docker logs <container-name>`. The following containers are
created (as shown for validator `0`), and you can replace the `0` with `1` or `2` to inspect the
other validators:

- `validator-0-fendermint`
- `validator-0-cometbft`
- `validator-0-promtail`
- `validator-0-objects`
- `validator-0-ethapi`
- `validator-0-iroh`
- `prometheus`
- `grafana`
- `anvil`
- `loki`

## Usage

You can test using the subnet with the
[`recall` SDK & CLI](https://github.com/recallnet/rust-recall). Keys _are not_ logged if you're
running a testnet. For localnet, keys _are_ logged with their corresponding balances. You'll notice
the first three accounts correspond to the validators and marked as reserved. If you're trying to do
non-validator actions (e.g., create a bucket or timehub), it's best to avoid these accounts since
nonce race conditions can occur.

```

You can use then these keys with the `recall` SDK and CLI by creating an `.env` file and sourcing
it, or by setting the variables in your shell. Keep in mind a `NETWORK` variable is used by
`fendermint` and `ipc-cli` but with a different value, so it's best to use separate terminal windows
when using the `recall` CLI alongside the others.

```dotenv
export RECALL_NETWORK=localnet
export RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY=7c852118294e51e653712a81e05800f419141751be58f605c371e15141b007a6
```

Then, use `recall` as normal, e.g., `recall account info` or `recall bucket create`. Similarly, the
Rust SDK lets you use the `localnet` by explicitly initializing it with
`recall_sdk::network::Network::Localnet.init()`, or the JS SDK lets you import the `localnet` chain.
