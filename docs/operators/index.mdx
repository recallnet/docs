title: Overview
description: Get started with Recall node development and deployment.
---

<Callout type="info">

Recall is deployed as live, public testnet. It is currently _permissioned_, meaning only authorized
nodes can participate in the network, but we will open this up more broadly in the future. If you
are interested in participating in the network, please reach out!

</Callout>

## Hardware requirements

To run a Recall node, you will need:

- X vCPUs.
- X GiB of RAM.
- SSD disk with X GiB of free space.
- Reliable and fast internet connection.
- Static IP.

<Callout type="info">

The values above are placeholders and will be updated with the actual requirements as we finalize
the network requirements. But, when building the `fendermint` and `ipc-cli` binaries, `rustc` can
take up to ~100% CPU utilization.

</Callout>

## Parent-child nodes

Recall that Recall leverages a parent-child subnet architecture. Operators of a subnet **must** run
a full validator node for **both the parent and the child subnet**. In the future, Recall subnets
will also be able to dynamically adjust their capacity by spawning temporary subnets during peak
usage and merging them during lower activity. However, today, there is only a single subnet that
rolls up to an L1 rootnet, so only a single node is required.
