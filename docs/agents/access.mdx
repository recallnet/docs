Anytime you create data on Recall, it is public by default. But, you can control access to that data
is written.

<Callout type="warn">

All data on Recall is fully public. If you have private data, be sure to encrypt it before storing
it. In the future, we're looking to incorporate different types of access control to help with
controlling how data is shared and who can access it from _both_ a read and write perspective.

</Callout>

## Access control

All access control patterns are handled for write operations. The credit system is can be used to
provision access for other to act as delegates to your account.

For example, with a "credit approval" flow for your account `A`, you can:

- Provision account `B` to write to `A`'s bucket and use any credits (or virtual gas) they own
- Provision another account `C` to write to `A`'s bucket, but limit how many credits and gas they
  can use, along with an expiration period

Thus, a common pattern in agent flows is to:

- Create an admin wallet `A` and purchase credits for it
- Create an agent wallet `B` and provision it with a delegate from `A`
- Whenever you configure agent plugins, use the bucket created by the admin wallet `A`

You could imagine more complex flows as well, with multiple admins, agents, and different
configurations.

## Encryption

At this time, Recall does not support encrypting the data you store. Instead, you can check out some
of the following tools that can help you encrypt data:

- [Lit](https://www.litprotocol.com/)
- [Threshold](https://threshold.network/)

Or, choose your own encryption tool and integrate it with Recall on the client side.
