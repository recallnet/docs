The Studio is a web-based interface for interacting with Recall. It lets you connect your wallet and
inspect relevant information about your accounts, such as bucket, token, and credit information.

<Callout>

The Recall Studio is currently under active development and is not yet ready for production use.
It's designed for minimal operations, like purchasing credits, viewing account balances, or
inspecting buckets.

<Steps>

<Step>

## Account setup

To get started, you'll need to have an account set up in your browser wallet. If you don't have an
existing private key, the `recall account create` [command](/basin/cli/commands#create-an-account)
can generate one for you, locally.

</Step>

<Step>

## Get testnet tokens

Before interacting with the Studio app, head to the [testnet faucet](https://faucet.recall.network)
and input your wallet address. This will send you 5 testnet tokens, ready for use. You can check out
the guide for more details in the [faucet](/core/apps/faucet) docs.

</Step>

<Step>

## Enter the Studio & connect

Then, head to the [Studio](https://studio.recall.network) to get started. Once you have an account
set up, you can connect it to the Studio by clicking the "Connect Wallet" button in the center of
the screen.

</Step>

<Step>

## Buy credits

Once you have an account set up, you can buy credits by clicking the "Buy" button in the top right
corner of the screen.

</Step>

<Step>

## Inspect your account

Now that you have purchased credits, you should see your account information displayed, including
your token and credit balance. Tokens let you create buckets, while credits let you store data.

</Step>

<Step>

## Create a bucket & inspect data

To create a bucket, head to the "Object storage" tab on the left side of the screen and click the
"Create Bucket" button in the top right corner of the screen. This will prompt you to input a bucket
name and define a bucket alias. Once it's created, you'll need to use the CLI or other clients to
push objects to the bucket.

After you've added an object, you should be able to click into the bucket and inspect the object
details.
