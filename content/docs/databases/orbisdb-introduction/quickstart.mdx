# Quickstart

A list of resources to get you started with decentralized data today.

## OrbisDB `Studio`

OrbisDB Studio is a shared node managed by the team behind OrbisDB. You can start exploring OrbisDB
with no downloads, setup or a single line of code. Check out our
[Managed section](/databases/orbisdb-setting-up/managed-studio) or
[visit the Studio](https://studio.useorbis.com/).

## OrbisDB `Node`

You can find the source code of OrbisDB nodes [in our Github](https://github.com/OrbisWeb3/orbisdb).
It's MIT licensed. Learn how to set up your node for local development or in the cloud in our
[Setting up section](/databases/orbisdb-setting-up).

## OrbisDB `Dashboard`

To learn more about our Data dashboard and node management, check out our
[Dashboard reference](/databases/orbisdb-dashboard-reference).

## OrbisDB `SDK`

To read and write data programmatically, you need an SDK. Check out the
[source code](https://github.com/OrbisWeb3/db-sdk) or the
[package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@useorbis/db-sdk) and install it using your favorite package
manager. Quickstart your decentralized data journey with our
[SDK Reference](/databases/orbisdb-sdk-reference).

### Installing the SDK

You can use your package manager of choice, in this case we'll be using NPM.

```bash
npm install @useorbis/db-sdk
```

## Docker **`Coming soon`**

We are working on Docker images to simplify the setup process with prebuilt binaries and bundled
options.
