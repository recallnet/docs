title: Contract & chain info
description: Core contracts & network information for interacting with the Recall network.
---

You can find all of the testnet information below, such as contract addresses and chain information.

<Callout type="warn"  >

The Recall network is still under development, so these values are **heavily** subject to change.
The testnet will be upgraded every ~2 weeks, and each upgrade will change certain contract
addresses.

## Testnet

### Chain & subnet ID

| Description | Value                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Chain ID    | `2481632`                                               |
| Subnet ID   | `/r314159/t410fxhurcl3in7vbb3l245noc3nace7il74t45js7sa` |

### Contracts

#### Core

| Description               | Address                                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Subnet gateway            | `0x77aa40b105843728088c0132e43fc44348881da8` |
| Subnet registry           | `0x74539671a1d2f1c8f200826baba665179f53a1b7` |
| Parent gateway            | `0x45da97E918183cA1f2891E277F600fC0B2dDD9dC` |
| Parent registry           | `0xd7719695eE7042cDCFF4065ef93346bF33222d78` |
| Parent supply source      | `0x2e6453107b4417eC2fB58ABDcc2968955Bd005Df` |
| Parent validator gater    | `0x7180b1e71814a3cdc62a414ae02e3f6e1314b209` |
| Parent validator rewarder | `0xD67851A6888556111087E24519b6D70DA57dAa5F` |
| Parent subnet actor       | `0xb9e9112f686fea10ed7ae75ae16da0113e85ff93` |

Note that the subnet contracts will always be the same for any new subnet deployed. The parent
contracts may change, up until the testnet is stabilized.

#### Solidity wrappers

The Solidity wrappers are libraries that facilitate making calls to the Wasm runtime. Anyone can
deploy them, but the following addresses are the ones that are officially supported:

| Description    | Address                                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Blob manager   | `0x7180B1e71814A3cdC62A414Ae02e3f6E1314B209` |
| Bucket manager | `0xfbCF213040240BA86Fed92961BB60625233641a1` |
| Credit manager | `0xDB85431B6a016e1652c7E898918d787B6aef7185` |

## Localnet

### Chain & subnet ID

Since localnet is a deterministic local-only development network, the subnet ID and chain ID will
always be the same.

| Description | Value                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Chain ID    | `248163216`                                             |
| Subnet ID   | `/r314159/t410f6gbdxrbehnaeeo4mrq7wc5hgq6smnefys4qanwi` |

### Contracts

| Parent subnet actor       | `0xf1823bc4243b40423b8c8c3f6174e687a4c690b8` |

#### Solidity wrappers

| Description    | Address                                      |

| Credit manager | `0x82C6D3ed4cD33d8EC1E51d0B5Cc1d822Eaa0c3dC` |

## Devnet

Since devnet is also a deterministic local-only development network, the subnet ID and chain ID will
always be the same. It differs from the localnet in that it doesn't have the concept of a "parent"
chain and is meant for testing core protocol changes.

### Chain & subnet ID

| Description | Value              |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| Chain ID    | `1942764459484029` |
| Subnet ID   | `test`             |

#### Core

| Description               | Address                                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Subnet gateway            | `0x77aa40b105843728088c0132e43fc44348881da8` |
| Subnet registry           | `0x74539671a1d2f1c8f200826baba665179f53a1b7` |


### Contracts

The devnet does not deploy contracts. You'll have to run the devnet's built-in EVM API feature and
deploy all contracts yourself.
