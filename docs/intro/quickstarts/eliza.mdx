description: A simple agent that can answer questions.
---

Get started with CoT logs and observability with the Recall agent starter kit. If you have an
existing agent, all you need to do is drop in a couple of small changes to your character's system
prompt and then expose the `plugin-recall-storage` to your agent.

You'll have to join the waitlist to get access to the Recall testnet. Fill out your information:

<Steps>

<Step>

## Installation

Clone the [Recall agent starter kit](https://github.com/recallnet/recall-agent-starter):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/recallnet/recall-agent-starter.git
```

Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd recall-agent-starter
```

Install the dependencies:

```package-install
npm install
```

Build the project:

```package-install
npm run build
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Set up your agent's account

In order to interact with Recall, you need an account (private key) that owns both credits and
tokens. If needed, you can create one by running the following command with the
[Recall CLI](/tools/cli/account#create-an-account), which prints both the private key and the public
key (address):

```bash
recall account create
```

Then, head to the [Recall Faucet](/intro/faucet) request some tokens with your address.

Lastly, you **must** purchase credits to store logs in your agents memory bucket—see the Portal
guide [here](/intro/portal) for more details. Alternatively, you can use the CLI to
[purchase credits](/tools/cli/account#buy-credit) for your agent to use, or purchase credit for your
personal account and [delegate access](/tools/cli/account#approve-credit) to your agent's wallet.

</Step>

<Step>

## Set up your environment

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following.

```bash
RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY="your-private-key"
RECALL_BUCKET_ALIAS="logs"
COT_LOG_PREFIX="cot/"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

An example character file is provided in `characters/eliza.character.json`, and it defaults to using
OpenAI models (but you can choose your own provider). You can customize this to your liking, but the
essential modifications include a CoT and reasoning logging:

- `system`: Modify the system prompt to coerce the model to reason through its response.
- `messageExamples`: Add examples of CoT and reasoning logging to help the model understand how to
  respond.

```json title="characters/eliza.character.json"
{
  "name": "Recall Agent",
  "modelProvider": "openai", // Optionally, change the model provider.
  // ...
  "system": "# Instructions: Think step-by-step before responding.\n\nPlease follow these steps in your chain-of-thought: ...",
  // ...
  "messageExamples": [
    [
      {
        "user": "{{user1}}",
        "content": {
          "text": "hey Recall Agent, you can add an object to the bucket named 'foo'?"
        }
      },
      {
        "user": "Recall Agent",
        "content": {
          "text": "<chain-of-thought>...</chain-of-thought>\nFinal Answer:\n..."
        }
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Run the agent

Being by running the `start` script, passing in the character file:

```package-install
npm run start -- --character characters/eliza.character.json
```

This will start up a chat agent that you can interact with. The agent will store CoT logs locally
and batch them into `jsonl` files at predefined intervals and size thresholds. As the model takes
actions, you'll be able to see the actions and batching logs:

```
[2025-02-07 17:13:31] INFO: Starting periodic log sync...
[2025-02-07 17:13:31] INFO: Looking for bucket with alias: logs
[2025-02-07 17:13:31] INFO: Bucket with alias "logs" not found, creating a new one.
[2025-02-07 17:13:36] INFO: Successfully created new bucket "logs" at 0xff0000000000000000000000000000000000008f
[2025-02-07 17:13:36] INFO: Found 1 unsynced logs.
[2025-02-07 17:13:36] INFO: Processing log entry of size: 861 bytes
[2025-02-07 17:13:36] INFO: Current batch size is 861 bytes, within the limit of 4 KB. Not syncing yet.
```

Let's send a simple message to the agent:

```
You: Create a bucket named 'recall-agent'
Agent: ✅ Successfully created or retrieved bucket **"recall-agent"** at address: **0xff00000000000000000000000000000000000094**
```

The step above will log information about what the agent is doing, but this is _only_ available
locally. Fore example, it's printed to the console, and only certain pieces might be included in the
default databases that come with the Eliza stack.

```
[2025-02-07 17:14:18] INFO: Executing handler for action: CREATE_BUCKET
[2025-02-07 17:14:18] INFO: CREATE_BUCKET Handler triggered: Create a bucket named 'recall-agent'
[2025-02-07 17:14:18] INFO: Creating bucket with alias: recall-agent
[2025-02-07 17:14:18] INFO: Looking for bucket with alias: recall-agent
[2025-02-07 17:14:18] INFO: Bucket with alias "recall-agent" not found, creating a new one.
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Inspect the logs and CoT

Once the batch size is exceeded, the logs will be synced to Recall:

```
[2025-02-07 17:14:21] INFO: Batch size currently 4423 bytes, exceeding limit of 4 KB. Syncing batch...
[2025-02-07 17:14:31] INFO: Batched JSONL logs stored under key: cot/1738948461879.jsonl
```

As the model progresses, you'll notice it automatically pull the logs into its context window:

```
[2025-02-07 17:14:21] INFO: Looking for bucket with alias: logs
[2025-02-07 17:14:21] INFO: Found existing bucket "logs" at 0xFF0000000000000000000000000000000000008f
[2025-02-07 17:14:27] INFO: Retrieving chain-of-thought logs from bucket: 0xFF0000000000000000000000000000000000008f
```

You can then use any Recall tooling to see _exactly_ what the agent did, such as with the
[CLI](/tools/cli):

```bash
recall bucket query --address 0xFF0000000000000000000000000000000000008f \
--prefix cot/
```

This will return all the logs in the bucket:

```
{
  "objects": [
    {
      "key": "cot/1738948461879.jsonl",
      "value": {
        "hash": "xipamlatvtmbub2prsirwywii4wgmhwzubez4dfcpupgagjwcmdq",
        "size": 682,
        "metadata": {
          "content-type": "application/octet-stream"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "common_prefixes": [],
  "next_key": null
}
```

Then, retrieve the logs and print them to the console:

```bash
recall bucket get --address 0xFF0000000000000000000000000000000000008f \
--key cot/1738948461879.jsonl
```

```json
{
  "userMessage": "Create a bucket named 'recall-agent'",
  "log": "1. The user, 12dea96f-ec20-0935-a6ab-75692c994959, has requested to create a bucket named 'recall-agent'.\n2. From the previous interactions, it is evident that the user has already been interacting with the Recall service, as seen from the queries about Recall.\n3. The task is straightforward: to create a new bucket with the specified name 'recall-agent' on the Recall service.\n4. The most appropriate action from the available actions is CREATE_BUCKET, as it directly aligns with the user's request to create a new bucket on the Recall service.\n5. There is no indication that this bucket already exists, so the action should proceed to create it."
}
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Visualize the logs

Head over to the [Recall Portal](https://portal.recall.network) and search for the bucket. This
gives you constant insight into what your model is doing. Not only help debug its performance, but
over time, the model and learn (and share) its finding with other agents!
