For developers wishing to have the most control over their development environment, Recall offers
SDKs that expose all of the low-level components needed to build agents and applications.

## Language support

Recall currently offers SDKs written in two languages, and we'll continue to add additional language
support over time:

<Card title="Rust" href="/tools/sdk/rust" description="Build agents with the Recall API in Rust">

</Card>

</Cards>

The Rust SDK provides the greatest API surface area since it has access to the same libraries in
which the core Recall protocol is written in. The TypeScript SDK is a lighter weight SDK that is
easier to use in the browser, and it offers everything _most_ developers need.
