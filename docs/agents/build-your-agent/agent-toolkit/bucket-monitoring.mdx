## Overview

When building agents with the Recall Agent Toolkit, understanding how to monitor and manage your
agent's storage is essential. This guide provides comprehensive methods for tracking, accessing, and
debugging the data your agents store in Recall buckets.

## Understanding bucket storage

Buckets are persistent storage containers used by agents in the Recall network. Each bucket:

- Has a unique identifier (e.g., `0xff000000000000000000000000000000000001a0`)
- Can contain multiple key-value pairs (objects)
- Persists data between agent sessions
- Can be monitored through various methods

  Without proper monitoring, it can be challenging to debug what your agent is storing and
  retrieving. Always implement logging for bucket operations.
</Callout>

The most important step in monitoring bucket storage is to log bucket IDs when they're created or
accessed. When an agent creates a bucket, it will have access to that information and can log it
accordingly.

## Methods for accessing bucket data

Once you know your bucket ID, you have multiple ways to view and manage the stored data:

### 1. Portal web interface

The simplest way to view bucket contents is through the Recall Portal:

1. Go to: `https://portal.recall.network/buckets/{YOUR_BUCKET_ID}`
2. Replace `{YOUR_BUCKET_ID}` with your actual bucket ID (e.g.,
   `0xff000000000000000000000000000000000001a0`)
3. You'll see all objects stored in the bucket, their keys, and values

The Portal provides a user-friendly interface to browse, search, and manage bucket contents without
coding.

</Callout>

### 2. Using the Recall CLI

The Recall CLI provides powerful command-line tools for viewing and managing bucket data. First,
follow the [installation instructions](/developer-resources/tools/cli) to install the CLI, and then you can run the
commands below.

```bash
export RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY=<your-private-key>
export BUCKET_ADDRESS=<your-bucket-address>
export OBJECT_KEY=<your-object-key>

# List all your buckets
recall bucket list

# List objects in a specific bucket
recall bucket query --address $BUCKET_ADDRESS

# View a specific object in a bucket
recall bucket get --address $BUCKET_ADDRESS $OBJECT_KEY

# Delete an object
recall bucket delete --address $BUCKET_ADDRESS $OBJECT_KEY
```

### 3. Portal login with agent's wallet

If you have access to the wallet used by your agent:

1. Go to the [Recall Portal](https://portal.recall.network)
2. Connect the same wallet used by your agent
3. Navigate to the "Storage" section
4. You'll see all buckets owned by the wallet

### 4. Programmatic monitoring

You can build monitoring capabilities directly into your agent application:

```typescript
import { testnet } from "@recallnet/chains";
import { RecallClient, walletClientFromPrivateKey } from "@recallnet/sdk/client";

const walletClient = walletClientFromPrivateKey(process.env.RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY, testnet);
const recallClient = new RecallClient({
  walletClient,
});
const client = recallClient.bucketManager();

async function monitorBuckets() {
  // List all buckets
  const { result: bucketsResponse } = await client.list();
  console.log("All buckets:", bucketsResponse);

  // For each bucket, list its contents
  for (const bucket of bucketsResponse) {
    console.log(`\nBucket ${bucket}:`);
    const { result: objectsResponse } = await client.query(bucket.addr);
    console.log("Objects:", objectsResponse.objects);

    // Print each object's key and value
    for (const object of objectsResponse.objects) {
      const { result: objectResponse } = await client.get(bucket.addr, object.key);
      console.log(`${object}: ${objectResponse}`);
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Querying the agent directly

If you're using MCP or a similar framework, you can simply prompt your agent to show its storage:

```
Please list all buckets you've created and their contents.
```

Agents with access to Recall tools can respond with complete information about their storage.

## Best practices for bucket monitoring

### Implement logging hooks

Always add logging for bucket operations in your agent code:

```typescript
// Example of a reusable logging middleware
const baseUrl = "https://portal.recall.network/buckets";

function logBucketOperation(operation, input, bucketId, key = null) {
  const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
  const portalUrl = `${baseUrl}/${bucketId}`;

  console.log(`[${timestamp}] ${operation.toUpperCase()} BUCKET: ${bucketId}`);
  console.log(`Portal URL: ${portalUrl}`);

  if (key) {
    console.log(`Key: ${key}`);
  }

  if (input.value && operation === "store") {
    console.log(`Stored value: ${JSON.stringify(input.value).substring(0, 100)}...`);
  }

  console.log("-".repeat(50));
}

const bucketLoggingMiddleware = {
  afterToolCall: (tool, input, output) => {
    // Log bucket creation/access
    if (tool.name === "get_or_create_bucket" && output?.result?.bucket) {
      logBucketOperation("create/access", input, output.result.bucket);
    }

    // Log object storage
    if (tool.name === "add_object" && output?.result?.success) {
      logBucketOperation("store", input, input.bucket, input.key);
    }

    // Log object retrieval
    if (tool.name === "get_object" && output?.result?.value) {
      logBucketOperation("retrieve", input, input.bucket, input.key);
    }
  },
};
```

### Develop a monitoring dashboard

For production agents, consider building a simple monitoring dashboard:

```typescript
import { testnet } from "@recallnet/chains";
import { RecallClient, walletClientFromPrivateKey } from "@recallnet/sdk/client";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
import express from "express";

dotenv.config();

const app = express();
const walletClient = walletClientFromPrivateKey(process.env.RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY, testnet);
const recallClient = new RecallClient({
  walletClient,
});
const client = recallClient.bucketManager();
const baseUrl = "https://portal.recall.network/buckets";

// Endpoint that displays all buckets and their contents
app.get("/buckets", async (req, res) => {
  const { result: bucketsResponse } = await client.list();

  let html = "<h1>Agent Buckets Monitor</h1>";

  for (const bucket of bucketsResponse) {
    html += `<h2>Bucket: ${bucket.addr}</h2>`; // Use bucket.addr instead of bucket
    html += `<p><a href="${baseUrl}/${bucket.addr}" target="_blank">View in Portal</a></p>`;

    // Add some debug logging
    console.log("Bucket:", bucket);
    const { result: objectsResponse } = await client.query(bucket.addr);
    console.log("Objects:", objectsResponse);

    html += '<table border="1"><tr><th>Key</th><th>Value</th></tr>';

    for (const item of objectsResponse.objects) {
      const { result: value } = await client.get(bucket.addr, item.key);
      console.log("Item:", item.key, value);
      // Convert value to string if it's an object
      const displayValue = typeof value === "object" ? JSON.stringify(value) : value;
      html += `<tr><td>${item.key}</td><td>${displayValue}</td></tr>`;
    }

    html += "</table>";
  }

  res.send(html);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Monitoring dashboard available at http://localhost:3000/buckets");
});
```

### Use structured logging

In production environments, use structured logging for better analysis:

```typescript
import pino from "pino";

const logger = pino({
  level: "info",
  transport: {
    target: "pino-pretty",
  },
});

function logBucketOperation(operation, bucketId, key = null, value = null) {
  const baseUrl = "https://portal.recall.network/buckets";
  logger.info({
    operation,
    bucketId,
    portalUrl: `${baseUrl}/${bucketId}`,
    key,
    value: value ? JSON.stringify(value).substring(0, 100) : undefined,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  });
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues and solutions

<Tabs items={["Missing data", "Permission errors", "Bucket not found"]}>
  <Tab value="Missing data">
    If data appears to be missing:

    1. Verify the correct bucket ID is being used
    2. Check that the object key matches exactly (keys are case-sensitive)
    3. Confirm the agent has permissions to access the bucket
    4. Examine logs to see if the data was ever successfully stored
    5. Try accessing the data through the Portal to confirm it exists

  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Permission errors">
    If you encounter permission errors:

    1. Confirm you're using the same private key that created the bucket
    2. Verify your agent has sufficient credits for storage operations
    3. Check that your client configuration is correct
    4. Try regenerating your API key if issues persist

  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Bucket not found">
    If a bucket appears to be missing:

    1. Confirm you're connected to the correct network (e.g., testnet)
    2. Verify the bucket ID format is correct (should start with `0xff`)
    3. Check logs to confirm the bucket was successfully created
    4. Use the `recall bucket list` command or Portal to see all available buckets
    5. Try creating a new bucket if necessary

  </Tab>
</Tabs>
