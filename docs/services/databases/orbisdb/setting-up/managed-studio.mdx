Running your own stack can feel overwhelming or simply an extra time spent you don't have while
bootstrapping your startup. To help you get started with your OrbisDB journey, we made sure to
include a ready-to-go option.

## OrbisDB Studio

We built [OrbisDB Studio](https://studio.useorbis.com/) to make your crypto developer journey as
simple as possible. OrbisDB Studio is a [shared OrbisDB instance](/databases/orbisdb-setting-up)
managed by Orbis. This means you don't have to worry about any of the backend requirements - just
set up your environment via UI and get started with decentralized data.

With a shared instance, each developer gets their own isolated database and environment - however,
the underlying hardware is shared. Once your application starts scaling you should consider a
dedicated instance.

Check out the [OrbisDB Studio](https://studio.useorbis.com/) and get started with decentralized
data, today.

## OrbisDB One **`Coming soon`**

Currently a work in progress, OrbisDB One is a cloud option managed by Orbis. Our cloud option will
allow you to easily spin up a dedicated OrbisDB instance from OrbisDB Studio with one click - same
user experience, but more scalability and customizations. Reach out with your requirements and help
us build a product for every scale - from an idea to millions of users.

## Managed partners

We are partnering with infrastructure and DePIN providers to help you run a hassle-free dedicated
OrbisDB instance. Our recommended OrbisDB and Ceramic provider is -
[HireNodes](https://hirenodes.io/).

## Alternative to managed

If you want more control and have experience running infrastructure, you should check out our
[self-hosting section](/databases/orbisdb-setting-up/local).

### Hybrid setup

OrbisDB is built out of multiple components. This architecture allows you to pick your battles and
choose which parts you want to host yourself, versus having someone else manage for you.

An example would be hosting the OrbisDB instance yourself, but using a managed Ceramic provider and
a DBaaS for your database.
