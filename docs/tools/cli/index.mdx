The Recall CLI is a command-line interface for interacting with the Recall network. It allows you to
manage your accounts, interact with smart contracts, and manage your data that gets stored on the
network.

<Steps>

<Step>

## Installation

You'll need to download the source code, build, and install the CLI.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/recallnet/rust-recall.git
cd rust-recall
make install
```

Once installed, you can run the `recall` command from your terminal.

```sh
recall --help
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Configure environment variables

The following environment variables are required for the majority of the `recall` subcommands:

- `RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY`: A wallet private key (ECDSA, secp256k1) for signing transactions.
- `RECALL_NETWORK`: Specify the chain location with RPC presets and settings that map to either
  `mainnet` (not available), `testnet` (default), `localnet`, or `devnet`.

These can be overridden with the flags `--private-key` and `--network`, respectively.

As a best practice, you should create a `.env` file with the following and run source it to ensure
the binary loads these variables. The default network is `testnet`, so it's not necessary to set the
network variable unless you're developing elsewhere (e.g., local development uses `localnet`).

```txt title=".env"
export RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
export RECALL_NETWORK=testnet
```

Then, make sure to run source it to load these variables:

```sh
source .env
```

</Step>

</Steps>

## Global options

All of the global flags can also be passed as all-caps (prefixed with `RECALL_`), snake case
environment variables that are set, or create and source them in a `env` file. For example,
`--network` => `RECALL_NETWORK`, `--private-key` => `RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY`, etc.

| Flag              | Description                                             | Env. variable          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `-n`, `--network` | Network presets for subnet and RPC (default: `testnet`) | `RECALL_NETWORK`       |
| `-s`, `--subnet`  | The ID of the target subnet.                            | `RECALL_SUBNET`        |
| `--rpc-url`       | Node CometBFT RPC URL.                                  | `RECALL_RPC_URL`       |
| `-v, --verbosity` | Logging verbosity (repeat for more verbosity).          | `RECALL_LOG_VERBOSITY` |
| `-q, --quiet`     | Silence logging (default: `false`).                     | `RECALL_LOG_QUIET`     |
| `-h, --help`      | Print help.                                             | -                      |
| `-V, --version`   | Print version.                                          | -                      |
