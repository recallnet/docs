## State of `DELETE`

<Callout type="warning">

Be careful when running `DELETE` queries using OribsDB SQL Editor. Make sure there's a **narrow and
specific WHERE clause**, otherwise you may end up deleting your entire table.

</Callout>

`DELETE` statement is not currently exposed to the end user. It's not a Ceramic or OrbisDB native
event.

The only way to handle `DELETE` queries it through your OrbisDB SQL Editor (link). Deleting the data
this way will **only remove it from your OrbisDB node**. You can't delete the original Ceramic
Stream or the underlying IPFS data.

These challenges are not unique to OrbisDB.

## Future plans

Even though `DELETE` statements aren't available as an OrbisDB or Ceramic native event, we do plan
to introduce it in the near future. We also have multiple options for handling these cases.

### OrbisDB `DELETE`

The first step to achieving native `DELETE` operations is by introducing a special `DELETE event`
Model that won't be indexed by default, however, all OrbisDB nodes will be subscribed to it.

Once an event is triggered, each OrbisDB node will verify whether it has any data relevant to this
event and will delete it if so. They will also unpin the Ceramic Stream's data from their internal
IPFS stores and block it from getting indexed in the future.

This event can only be triggered by the content's original author - its verifiable owner.

However, Ceramic nodes will not understand this event natively. The same could apply to some OrbisDB
nodes as the software is MIT-licensed and may be modified by the node controller.

### Ceramic `DELETE`

There have been discussions about a native `DELETE` even in Ceramic. We are actively involved in
them and are vocal about the importance of such event.

There's still the possibility of an IPFS node storing the content - or a 3rd party that's subscribed
to a certain topic.

### Subnets

Subnets would represent a subset of the network nodes. They may choose to apply different rules.

An example might be a private subnet in which case the data would only be distributed to a trusted
set of nodes.

There's no clear ETA for this, as it involves a tech stack outside of our direct control.

### Encryption

As data is coming through Ceramic - a public network - it needs to be encrypted client-side.
Currently, OrbisDB is storing encrypted content as-is, in its encrypted form.

A feature may be introduced for data to be encrypted to a set of nodes. These nodes could then
decrypt the data during indexing, allowing for all the query functionality. This would be
public-private subnet, since data is being distributed, but only a subset of nodes would be able to
interpret the data.

This may be introduced via [Plugins](/databases/orbisdb-plugins) or as an OrbisDB native feature.

It's not a work-in-progress and there are no ETAs\
It may be re-prioritized depending on the needs of our users.

## GDPR & CCPA

GDPR & CCPA are privacy regulations and acts. They are a step in the right direction when it comes
to users "owning" their data, or at least having some form of control over it.

At the heart of both of these is the "right to be forgotten". This is challenging for a technology
that relies on immutability. In case of OrbisDB, Ceramic or IPFS you as the node operator can remove
(forget) the content from your instances, but can't affect other node operators to which the data
has been distributed.

There's active discussions as to how the emerging blockchain technology can co-exist with acts such
as GDPR and CCPA. For more details, you can read the following:
