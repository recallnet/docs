<Steps>

<Step>

### Run the adapter

Start the adapter with the binary installed and flags described in the
[installation](/s3/installation) page.

```sh
recall_s3 \
--private-key [your_private_key] \
--access-key AKEXAMPLES3S \
--secret-key SKEXAMPLES3S
```

This will start the adapter on port `8014` by default. Also, recall the `--network` flag can,
optionally, be provided to point to a specific Recall chain environment, and logging can be enabled
by passing the `-v` flag.

</Step>

<Step>

### Run the S3 client

You can now use an S3-compatible client like MinIO to interact with Recall. First, make sure you
have the MinIO client installed, such as with Homebrew on Mac:

```sh
brew install minio/stable/mc
```

Then, add Recall as an alias to the MinIO configuration, and be sure to specify the API version as
`S3v4`. The URL shown below is the default port for the adapter, but you can change it by specifying
the `--address` flag.

```sh
mc alias set recall http://localhost:8014 AKEXAMPLES3S SKEXAMPLES3S --api s3v4
```

You can verify the alias was set properly with `mc alias list`:

```sh
recall
  URL       : http://localhost:8014
  AccessKey : AKEXAMPLES3S
  SecretKey : SKEXAMPLES3S
  API       : s3v4
  Path      : auto
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Create a bucket

Now, you can directly use MinIO to write or read data! Start by creating a bucket:

```sh
mc mb recall/foo
```

This will create the bucket called `foo` under your `recall` alias. But, recall that the bucket will
_actually_ get used under `<0x_address>.<bucket_name>`. The step below shows how to check the actual
bucket name.

</Step>

<Step>

### Check the bucket name

You can check the buckets under your alias with `mc ls recall`. This will list the bucket above with
the name we used:

```sh
[2024-11-20 21:18:07 EST]     0B foo/
```

When you interact with the bucket, you can either use the aliased or expanded format: the custom
alias name, or the alias prefixed with the public key (and a period delimiter). See the
[bucket usage](/tools/s3#create-an-aliased-bucket) section for more details.

</Step>

<Step>

### Write & read data

You can write to the address that identifies the bucket, where you'd replace `0x90f7...` with your
system-defined bucket name:

```sh
mc put ./test.txt recall/foo/world
```

Then, you can read the data back via stdout, or download it to a file:

```sh
mc cat recall/foo/world
mc get recall/foo/world ./downloaded-test.txt
```

</Step>
