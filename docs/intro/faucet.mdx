description: Request subnet testnet funds to get started with Recall development.

The Recall faucet is a free service that drips subnet tokens to your testnet wallet. It sends **5
RECALL** to your wallet, and note it has builtin rate limiting to prevent abuse.

### Faucet sign in

First, head to faucet at: [https://faucet.recall.network](https://faucet.recall.network). It should
verify you're not a bot through Cloudflare protections.

<Step>

### Request funds

Input your wallet address and click `Request RECALL`. It should take a matter of seconds before the
funds are available in your account, and upon success, a notification will show the transaction
hash.

### Start building

Now that you have funds in your wallet, you're all set to start building on Recall, such as
purchasing credit or storing data! Be sure to use the same private key you used to sign up for the
faucet when you use tools like the Studio, CLI, or any other Recall tooling—or review the access
control section to implement approval flows.
