title: Contract & chain info
description: Core contracts & network information for interacting with the Recall network.
---

You can find all of the testnet information below, such as contract addresses and chain information.

<Callout type="warning"  >

The Recall network is still under development, so these values are **heavily** subject to change.
The testnet will be upgraded every ~2 weeks, and each upgrade will change certain contract
addresses.

## Testnet

### Chain & subnet ID

| Description | Value                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Chain ID    | `2481632`                                               |
| Subnet ID   | `/r314159/t410f4f5jzfsftk6zqvcq3c4rrt372itjg6qh5b33dwq` |

### Contracts

#### Core

| Description               | Address                                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Subnet gateway            | `0x77aa40b105843728088c0132e43fc44348881da8` |
| Subnet registry           | `0x74539671a1d2f1c8f200826baba665179f53a1b7` |
| Parent gateway            | `0x88b497225c33dDF92A4F94C0C82a20044e68Bc9E` |
| Parent registry           | `0x4665468636B81481adac664993782609a1F3cB30` |
| Parent supply source      | `0xA7D1A73173A6854b7C8c1DF4d22a1d39BfcFb021` |
| Parent validator gater    | `0x3d63f2e9fe4e5d7b0e4c97a8720b43dd55f82cf4` |
| Parent validator rewarder | `0x8d235338cf5fDFA39857a135d6314890615b986b` |
| Parent subnet actor       | `0xe17a9c96459abd985450d8b918cf7fd226937a07` |

Note that the subnet contracts will always be the same for any new subnet deployed. The parent
contracts may change, up until the testnet is stabilized.

#### Solidity wrappers

The Solidity wrappers are libraries that facilitate making calls to the Wasm runtime. Anyone can
deploy them, but the following addresses are the ones that are officially supported:

| Description    | Address                                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Blob manager   | `0x39E39A2dcdB7340CE12c67f4C25f2A5183a5f70d` |
| Bucket manager | `0x48E6c6d0745795Ae0CaeA74a0f1E113Cb5365DC3` |
| Credit manager | `0x612308d30FB994FEF12F2C4e0534a44e3fb6d323` |

## Localnet

### Chain & subnet ID

Since localnet is a deterministic local-only development network, the subnet ID and chain ID will
always be the same.

| Description | Value                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Chain ID    | `248163216`                                             |
| Subnet ID   | `/r314159/t410f6gbdxrbehnaeeo4mrq7wc5hgq6smnefys4qanwi` |

### Contracts

#### Core

| Description               | Address                                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Subnet gateway            | `0x77aa40b105843728088c0132e43fc44348881da8` |
| Subnet registry           | `0x74539671a1d2f1c8f200826baba665179f53a1b7` |

| Parent validator gater    | `0x70e0bA845a1A0F2DA3359C97E0285013525FFC49` |
| Parent validator rewarder | `0x09635F643e140090A9A8Dcd712eD6285858ceBef` |
| Parent subnet actor       | `0xf1823bc4243b40423b8c8c3f6174e687a4c690b8` |

#### Solidity wrappers

| Description    | Address                                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Blob manager   | `0xe1Aa25618fA0c7A1CFDab5d6B456af611873b629` |
| Bucket manager | `0xf7Cd8fa9b94DB2Aa972023b379c7f72c65E4De9D` |
| Credit manager | `0x82C6D3ed4cD33d8EC1E51d0B5Cc1d822Eaa0c3dC` |

## Devnet

Since devnet is also a deterministic local-only development network, the subnet ID and chain ID will
always be the same. It differs from the localnet in that it doesn't have the concept of a "parent"
chain and is meant for testing core protocol changes.

### Chain & subnet ID

| Description | Value              |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| Chain ID    | `1942764459484029` |
| Subnet ID   | `test`             |

### Contracts

The devnet does not deploy contracts. You'll have to run the devnet's built-in EVM API feature and
deploy all contracts yourself.
