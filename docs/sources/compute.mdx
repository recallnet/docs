title: Compute over data
description: Learn how to run compute over onchain data.
keywords: compute, compute over data, onchain
---

The previous sections about reading and writing data focused on how to store data onchain, but only
allowed you to read it from an offchain location. Recall also allows you to run compute _onchain_
over your stored data through programmable contract logic.

Recall is currently building lightweight compute primitives; check back soon for the latest updates.
We're also open to working with large scale compute providers to make this easier for everyone.
Reach out if you're interested in building with us!
