collaboration"},"content":"## What is an agent?\n\nAgents are systems that learn and evolve through memory and collaboration—often used to automate\ntasks, solve problems, and make decisions. There are many different types of agents and frameworks\nthat make it easy to add actions and evaluators as additional tools the agent can use, while also\npreserving its knowledge and memory with database storage.\n\nSome popular web3-native frameworks include, all of which offer onchain compatible features:\n\n* [Eliza](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza)\n* [GAME](https://github.com/game-by-virtuals/game-node)\n* [ZerePy](https://github.com/blorm-network/ZerePy/)\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n  Many frameworks offer S3-compatible storage, allowing you to store agent data alongside the\n  [Recall S3 adapter](/advanced/s3). However, we're working to add more Recall-native plugins to make\n  it easier to store agent data—the first of which is available with\n  [Eliza and storing CoT logs](/agents/plugins/eliza/cot).\n</Callout>\n\n### Agent layers\n\nAn agent is made up of four layers:\n\n* **Perception**: Acts as the agent's sensory system, gathering and interpreting data from the\n  environment, such as analyzing text / images, or accessing information from external sources.\n* **Decision-Making**: Evaluates the perceived information and decides on the appropriate actions to\n  take, including reasoning, planning, and strategizing to achieve the agent's goals.\n* **Execution**: Carries out the decisions made by the decision-making layer by translating the\n  chosen actions into concrete steps within the environment (e.g., sending messages, interacting\n  with other agents, or manipulating objects).\n* **Memory**: Stores and manages the agent's knowledge and experiences, including short-term memory\n  for immediate tasks and long-term memory for accumulated knowledge, allowing the agent to learn\n  and adapt over time.\n\n### Memory types\n\nSince Recall can store arbitrary data, there are many ways you can store relevant agent information.\nIt is important to understand the different types of use cases that can be addressed with the\nnetwork.\n\n* **Short-term memory**: Working memory for a single task or decision, like a chatbot interaction\n  with a single user and thread.\n* **Long-term memory**: Aggregated memory designed to improve the agent's overall intelligence over\n  time, consisting of:\n\n  * **Semantic**: General knowledge and facts (e.g., theorems, user preferences, etc.).\n  * **Episodic**: Experiences (e.g., past actions and their consequences).\n  * **Procedural**: Learned behaviors and patterns (e.g., system prompts, tool usage, etc.).\n\n## Stateful agents\n\nWhen you use an LLM, it is *stateless*. It will generate a response based on the input and the state\nof the model at the time, but that's it. With a *stateful* agent, you can store information between\ninteractions to improve the agent's performance over time.\n\nFor example, a stateful agent will have both working and long-term memories, allowing it to:\n\n* Use past actions and their consequences to inform future actions.\n* Use general knowledge and facts to inform future actions.\n* Use past experiences to inform future actions.\n\nAs the agent progressively uses more data and performs more actions, it can store that data on\nRecall and load it into its context. Particularly, data like CoT and related reasoning can be\nparticularly helpful for the model to better understand what *thinking* steps it has take in the\npast—and not solely the action it

machine replication","description":"Dig into the consensus mechanisms behind Recall's state replication.","category":"System Architecture and protocol design","keywords":""},"content":"## CometBFT\n\nWithin a subnet,\n[state machine replication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_machine_replication) is achieved via\n[CometBFT](https://cometbft.com/) (originally known as\n[*Tendermint*](https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/items/5459099e-67aa-4a23-83ae-d3471d8d8336)).\nCometBFT's consensus algorithm is based on a variant of\n[Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/571637.571640) (PBFT) and\nrelies on a round-robin proposer selection mechanism, while incorporating elements that improve on\nPBFT's performance and communication overhead (see also the\n[Cosmos whitepaper](https://cosmos.network/resources/whitepaper)). It is a fast, battled-tested, and\nwell-designed consensus engine.\n\nRecall's blockchain functionality is exposed as a unified\n[ABCI++](https://members.delphidigital.io/learn/abci) application controlled by CometBFT. ABCI\nprograms are an interface between CometBFT and the actual state machine being replicated. That is,\nABCIs implement deterministic state machines to be securely replicated by the CometBFT consensus\nengine. In this sense, CometBFT acts as a standalone process that issues commands to an underlying\nABCI++ application and exposes a public JSON RPC API, much like the Ethereum JSON RPC API.\n\n<Callout>\n  The \"++\" in ABCI++ refers to additional functionality that CometBFT enables compared to the original ABCI, which helps improve the overall scalability and feature surface area.\n</Callout>\n\n## Fendermint\n\nRecall consensus is heavily based on IPC\n[Fendermint](https://github.com/consensus-shipyard/ipc/tree/main/fendermint), which is a specialized\nABCI++ interface to its\n[execution virtual machine](https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/fundamentals/the-fvm) (Wasm\nwith EVM compatibility). Fendermint exposes EVM/Wasm-specific functionality within subnets, allowing\nRecall subnets to behave with custom parameters to greatly improve throughput and features.\n\nThe unique features of Fendermint include a modified *interpreter stack* which is responsible for\nhandling commands from CometBFT. This is a layered series of interpreters that are initialized when\nthe ABCI++ application is built. Fendermint also includes a *snapshot manager* that allows\n[CAR files](https://ipld.io/specs/transport/car/) to be offered to peers for quick chain sync, and\nan *IPLD resolver* that is used to resolve\n[content identifiers (CIDs)](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/#) between peers.\nThis IPLD resolver is a libp2p-based service that was originally developed to support bottom-up\ncheckpoints, which are collection of messages from a child subnet that should be executed by parent\nvalidators. In practice, Recall passes checkpointed headers to its parent and uses the CometBFT\nledger to gather relevant signatures etc., and the parent subnet then leverages the IPLD resolver to\nfetch the actual messages and execute them.\n\n## Checkpointing\n\nCheckpointing is how Recall subnets push data commitments up the hierarchy to the root subnet, as\nwell as other chains. This check-pointing process is a key component of the hierarchical\narchitecture of Recall, and is a core component of the IPC protocol.\n\nRecall subnets are continuously exchanging data with their parent chain (another subnet or a rootnet\nlike Filecoin) and (possibly) child subnets, so in addition to bottom-up checkpoints, subnet may\nleverage *top-down sync*, when subnets must have a view of their parent finality, which includes the\nlatest block hash, power table information, and potentially cross-subnet message passing.\n\n## Accounts\n\nAccounts in Recall are based on standard public-private key pair cryptography, using the ECDSA\nalgorithm with the [secp256k1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1) curve.

core building blocks for data exchange.","category":"System Architecture and protocol design","keywords":""},"content":"Recall's core functionality is built as a series of Wasm-based contracts that run on the Wasm\nexecution layer and are used to manage, query, and update the state of the subnet. In effect, the\nWasm runtime is responsible for executing the logic of the Recall protocol.\n\n## Contract execution\n\nThe runtime executes messages in [Wasm](https://webassembly.org/) over actor state and uses the\n[Wasmtime runtime](https://wasmtime.dev/). This includes a Wasm implementation of the\n[EVM bytecode](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf) interpreter. Under the hood, any\n\"built-in\" and \"custom\" (subnet-specific) Wasm contracts are compiled to\n[CAR](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/how-ipfs-works/#how-ipfs-represents-and-addresses-data) files\nand provided to the subnet during genesis.\n\n<Callout>\n  For further details on how the Wasm runtime works, check out the deep dive\n  [here](https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/fundamentals/the-fvm).\n</Callout>\n\nWithin Recall, our default contracts are called ***Wasm contracts***. These are the core building\nblocks of Recall; each Wasm contract has its own unique address and is associated with a unique\nowner address. This helps track which contracts are tied to a given account. At present, Recall\nships with three core Wasm contracts: the *address manager*, *bucket*, and *timehub*. These\ncontracts are responsible for managing the state of a subnet, creating new buckets, timehubs, and\nstoring and retrieving data from the subnet.\n\nOne of the main advantages of the Wasm runtime is its support for [IPLD](https://ipld.io/), a\nhash-linked data model that can be used to represent and traverse hash-linked data. It's the basis\nfor those familiar with IPFS. All onchain data is represented as IPLD, which is stored in the state\ntree of the subnet. Notably, this means you can create Wasm contracts that *use* IPLD (e.g., Rust's\n[libipld](https://github.com/ipld/libipld) crate).\n\n## Wasm vs. smart contracts\n\nSubnets use the Wasm runtime because it offers flexible and data-oriented programmatic control. The\nruntime is simply an IPLD-friendly virtual machine that supports Wasm actors and other handy\nfeatures.\n\nThis flexibility enables the creation of both smart contract and Wasm contracts, the latter of which\nallows developers to write programs in languages like Rust, significantly broadening the range of\nservices and products that can be built. Since the runtime maintains full EVM compatibility,\ntraditional smart contracts can also be written in Solidity. This dual capability ensures that\ndevelopers can leverage the best tools for their specific needs.\n\n## Wasm contracts\n\nRecall comes with a few built-in Wasm contracts that are used to manage the state of the subnet and\nimplement core data structures.\n\n### Address manager\n\nClients are able to deploy new buckets on demand using the singleton address manager. The primary\nfunction of the address manager is to create other *Wasm contracts* and assign them a unique\naddress. Each Wasm contract is associated with a unique address (which is used to identify the store\non the network), and an owner address.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    subgraph Chain[\"State\"]\n      subgraph Metadata[\"Metadata (Hamt)\"]\n          Root -->|Owner Addr| One[\"[0x1234]\"]\n          Root -->|Owner Addr| Two[\"[0x5678]\"]\n          Root -->|Owner Addr| Three[\"[0x4321,\\\\n0x8765]\"]\n        end\n    end\n\n```\n\n### Buckets\n\nBuckets are deployed as instances of the bucket Wasm contract. This contract is responsible for\nmanaging the state of the bucket itself, including creating, updating, and deleting keys/objects.\nEach bucket manages its own metadata state, which is stored on the network and can be accessed by\nother contracts. The bucket contract provides a set of methods for interacting with the store,\nincluding `add`, `get`, `query`, and `delete`, which allow clients to store and retrieve data from\nthe bucket.\n\nThese are key-value stores that allow you to push and retrieve data in a familiar S3-like fashion.\nBuckets also support byte range requests and advanced queries based on key prefix, delimiter,\noffset, and limit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n  subgraph State[\"State\"]\n    subgraph Chain[\"Onchain\"]\n      subgraph Metadata[\"Metadata (Hamt)\"]\n          Root -->|Foo Key| FooCid[\"Foo Cid\"]\n          Root -->|Bar Key| BarBlock[\"Bar Blob\"]\n          Root -->|Baz Key| BazCid[\"Baz Cid\"]\n        end\n      subgraph Blockstore[\"Blockstore\"]\n        FooBlob[\"Foo Blob\"]\n      end\n      FooCid -->|CID| FooBlob\n    end\n    subgraph External[\"Offchain\"]\n      subgraph Other[\"Blockstore\"]\n        BazBlob[\"Baz Blob\"]\n      end\n    end\n    BazCid -->|CID| BazBlob\n  end\n\n```\n\nInternally, the state of a bucket is represented as an\n[IPLD-based HAMT](https://ipld.io/specs/advanced-data-layouts/hamt/spec/)\n([hash array mapped trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie)). The IPLD data\nmodel provides a flexible and extensible way to represent complex data structures, and the\n[invariants and mutation rules](https://michael.steindorfer.name/publications/oopsla15.pdf) enforced\nby the IPLD HAMT provides us with the ability to maintain canonical forms given any set of keys and\ntheir values, regardless of insertion order and intermediate data insertion and deletion. Therefore,\nfor any given set of keys and their values, we get a consistent bucket configuration, such that the\nroot node will always produce the same CID.\n\n<Callout>\n  The root commitments (a CID) of the HAMT provide the cryptographic hash required for onchain proof\n  verification.\n</Callout>\n\nThe HAMT itself references the blobs of the bucket, which may be included directly (for smaller\npayloads that fit entirely within a single transaction), or as part of a *detached payload*. When\nrequired, Recall can leverage the IPLD resolver (and store) to read and write data to its internal\nstate, so that it is IPLD

availability","description":"A general purpose data overlay fulfilling data availability requirements.","category":"System Architecture and protocol design","keywords":""},"content":"In Recall, data commitments are maintained onchain but actual data storage is managed offchain. This\ndesign choice is driven by the need to maintain chain liveness and limit the demands on validator\nresources, as storing large volumes of data onchain can lead to bloating and reduced efficiency.\nRecall partly addresses these scalability issues through the use of hierarchical consensus and\ndetached payload transactions with a custom synchronization and consensus protocol. However, this\nrequires care in order to maintain the overall integrity, and reliability of our system. In\nparticular, Recall needs to support the following additional core requirements to maintain data\nsecurity:\n\n* **Data integrity**: Stakeholders must have mechanisms to verify that the data has not been altered\n  or tampered with since its original commitment,\n* **Data robustness**: The system must be designed to handle situations where data becomes\n  inaccessible or corrupted, including methods for recovering or reconstructing lost or compromised\n  data,\n* **Data accessibility**: Stakeholders must have mechanisms to ensure that their data is being\n  correctly stored and retrievable across the network, and\n* **Data availability**: Stakeholders must have a means to request and receive offchain data when\n  required.\n\n## Data availability approaches\n\nExisting projects address one or more of these security requirements but seldom cover all four\ncomprehensively. For instance, most blockchain-based systems provide a degree of data **integrity**\nthrough the use of data commitment schemes (i.e., authenticated data structures), whereas\nstorage-centric protocols predominantly focus on proofs of storage, emphasizing data possession and\nvalidator access (i.e., data **accessibility**). Recently,\n[data **availability**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09044) has become a focal point in blockchain\nscaling discussions, with systems increasingly concentrating on ensuring that clients can reliably\naccess transaction data from rollups, and/or via light-clients. In all these cases, data\n**robustness** is often addressed through a combination of replication, and data redundancy\ntechniques.\n\nAlternative protocols used in some data-focused blockchain systems to ensure (some variant of) data\navailability include\n[proofs of data possession, proofs of of retreivability](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec21-anthoine.pdf),\nand Filecoin's\n[proof of replication (PoRep)](https://research.protocol.ai/publications/proof-of-replication/benet2017.pdf)\nand related mechanisms. In systems where the consensus protocol itself is used to ensure data\navailability, such as Arweave's [proofs of access](https://www.arweave.org/yellow-paper.pdf),\nproposers are required to include additional (past) data in their blocks (called a recall block),\nand validators are required to verify the included proof of access. In practice, these types of\nproofs are designed to demonstrate that a prover actually has the bytes of data that they should\nhave, and perhaps more importantly, that they *continue* to have the bytes of data that they should\nhave for the period of time that they should have them.\n\nIn order to address all four of Recall's core data security requirements, we employ features from\nboth data availability and data accessibility protocol designs.\n\n## Erasure coding\n\n[Erasure coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasure_code) is a technique used in data storage and\ntransmission systems to enhance data reliability and fault tolerance. It involves breaking down a\ndata object into smaller fragments and then generating additional redundant fragments using\nmathematical algorithms. These redundant fragments are distributed across different storage nodes or\ntransmitted through different channels. In the event of data loss or corruption, the original data\ncan be reconstructed from a subset of the fragments, as long as a sufficient number of fragments\nremain intact.\n\nMost existing data availability protocols rely on a combination of random sampling and erasure\ncoding, an approach we also adopt in Recall. In the context of data availability sampling, when a\nnode needs to verify data availability, it randomly samples a subset of the *coded* fragments. Due\nto the properties of erasure encoding, any sufficiently large subset of fragments (defined by the\nencoding scheme) can be used to reconstruct the original data. This allows nodes to verify the\npresence of the entire dataset without needing to store or access all fragments. By combining\nerasure encoding with data availability sampling, a system can efficiently detect and mitigate data\nwithholding or loss, thereby maintaining the robustness and reliability of the distributed storage\nsolution.\n\n### Alpha entanglement\n\nRecall employs [Alpha Entanglement (AE) codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02974) to encode data\nfragments, which differs from commonly deployed Reed-Solomon erasure codes,. AE codes are a\nspecialized XOR-based coding scheme specifically designed for distributed systems, and provide a\nnumber of advantages over other commonly used erasure codes.\n\nAdvantages of Alpha Entanglement codes include:\n\n* **Space Efficiency**: AE codes create redundancy with less storage overhead compared to simple\n  replication methods.\n* **Data Integrity**: The entanglement of blocks provides an additional layer of integrity\n  protection, making unauthorized modifications easily detectable.\n* **Efficient Repairs**: AE codes allow for efficient recovery of missing data blocks using other\n  entangled blocks, reducing the bandwidth required for repairs.\n* **Decentralized Repair**: The repair process can be distributed among multiple nodes, balancing\n  the load and improving the speed of recovery.\n* **Random Access**: AE codes support efficient random access to data blocks, unlike some\n  traditional erasure codes that require reconstructing larger portions of data.\n* **Scalability**: The interdependencies between blocks help in maintaining data integrity and\n  availability even in large and dynamic network environments.\n* **Code Locality**: Alpha entanglement codes excel at code locality, hence they reduce repair cost\n  and are less dependent on storage locations with poor availability.\n\nAlpha entanglement codes are constructed by \"entangling\" data and redundant blocks in a\nmulti-dimensional lattice structure. The encoding process involves creating interconnected\n*strands*, where each strand represents a specific type of entanglement. The entanglement function\ncomputes the exclusive-or (XOR) of consecutive data/parity blocks within a strand, **propagating\nredundant information across the mesh-like structure**. The number of parities per data block,\ndetermined by the parameter $α$, influences the level of redundancy and fault tolerance in the\nsystem. Additionally, the parameters $s$ and $p$ dictate the number of horizontal and helical\nstrands, respectively, further shaping the resilience of the storage architecture without\nsignificantly increasing storage overhead.\n\n<Callout>\n  Alpha increases storage overhead linearly but increases the possible paths to recover data\n  exponentially.\n</Callout>\n\nThe encoder builds chains of blocks (i.e., strands) that alternate data and redundant (parity)\nblocks. The entanglement function computes the XOR of two consecutive blocks at the head of a strand\nand inserts the output adjacent to the last block. The strands are intertwined creating a mesh of\nentangled blocks, a so-called **cylindrical helical lattice**. This process is similar to a\nfunctional scan over the input data, providing intermediate entangled outputs that can be used to\nrecover the original data in case of data loss, or used for availability sampling by the network.\n\nThe outputs from alpha entanglement can be arranged in a Merkle structure, known as an\n[entangled Merkle tree](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3464298.3493397) (eMT) or more generally,\nan entangled directed acyclic graph (eDAG). These eDAGs are based on a specialized arrangement of\ndata blocks from Merkle structures, which when coded, form an authenticated data structure that\nreduces the impact of hierarchical dependencies in the internal DAG structure. We apply the\nIPLD-based adjustments to entangled Merkle trees as suggested\n[here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16210) and\n[here](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/dedis/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/report-2022-3-QiyuanandYuening-making_IPFS_More_Reliable.pdf).\n\n<Callout>\n  See the [original Snarl paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3464298.3493397) for details on\n  mapping a Merkle DAG into an authenticated lattice structure.\n</Callout>\n\nInitially, the entangled Merkle tree blocks are automatically distributed (evenly) across the\nnetwork, and Recall uses [consistent hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing), to\ndistribute the data and parity blocks among a dynamic set of validator nodes. In practice, Recall\nuses a redundancy strategy that ensures that the replication factor for each node in the lattice is\na function of its depth in the resulting eDAG (i.e., nodes closer to the root are replicated more\nthan data and parity blocks closer to the leafs).\n\n<Callout>\n  This replication strategy is simply an\n  [implementation detail](https://github.com/dedis/student_23_ipfs_reliability), and the protocol\n  itself does not require any specific strategy. This allows for flexibility in the design of the\n  network and the ability to adapt to different use cases and requirements. Additionally, it leaves\n  room for future optimizations and improvements to the replication strategy based on real-world data\n  and the tokenomics of the system. Another feature of AE codes that is useful here, is that the codes\n  themselves can be adaptive, and parameters can be allowed to change over time.\n</Callout>\n\n## Data accessibility\n\nRecall from the previous section that alpha entanglement works by **propagating redundant\ninformation across the mesh-like structure.** In practice, this means that in order to compute\nparity blocks for new incoming data, the new data must be combined (XOR) with past/current data.\nRecall takes advantage of this process by requiring validators to alpha entangle new chunks of data\nwith past chunks, to create a self-repairing data lattice.\n\nEach new data file/blob that is added to a Recall bucket machine via a detached payload transaction\nhas already been chunked into fixed size chunks, and forms a content-addressable DAG. Each data\nchunk within the DAG, including intermediate nodes of the tree, have a unique hash address (i.e.,\nCID). As each chunk is ingested into the system it is entangled with a pseudorandomly selected past\nchunk from the existing data lattice.\n\n<Callout>\n  Note that this chunking and DAG construction process is already part of the object API that Recall\n  uses for detached payloads. The input data is essentially an IPFS-compatible IPLD encoded DAG.\n</Callout>\n\n### A note on data retention\n\nOne of the stated goals of Recall is to support custom time-to-live (TTL) data life-cycles in\nsubnets. This is in contrast to existing data availability solutions, where there are very\nwell-defined and fixed TTL requirements. Again, we leverage the entanglement process to our\nadvantage to\n[support varying TTL requirements](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328416034_Practical_erasure_codes_for_storage_systems_The_study_of_entanglement_codes_an_approach_that_propagates_redundancy_to_increase_reliability_and_performance)\nwithin a bucket.\n\nEach new file or blob added to a bucket is required to have an associated *retention policy* as part\nof its object metadata. Given that time in Recall is measured in block time, this retention policy\nis specified as a TTL in blocks (e.g., TTL = 5). For a file/blob added at block 10, with a TTL of\n(at least) 5 blocks, we then assign it to *retention group* 15. When entangling data, validators\nmust always entangle incoming data (and associated chunks) with pseudorandom chunks from the correct\nretention group (or a retention group with a longer TTL). This ensures that data that should remain\n\"available\" together are physically and semantically grouped. If it is not possible to entangle a\ngiven data chunk with other data from its intended retention group (e.g., due to lack of preexisting\ndata), it can be entangled with data in a later group, or with itself (creating a so-called *closed*\nentanglement) in the worst case. Note that this process must be done in conjunction with the\ndeterministic blockweave based approach to selecting recall/entanglement

the basics behind what subnets are and how they work.","category":"System Architecture and protocol design","keywords":""},"content":"Recall is a decentralized at data network optimized for data-intensive applications. It exposes a\nunified data layer backed by a consensus-driven network of actors supporting a fully decentralized,\npermissionless, and ownerless architecture. The consensus layer itself is purpose-built to address\nthe needs of modern data-hungry applications and services, and this design enables a number of\nadditional innovations, including Recall's *synchronous data synchronization* mechanism, allowing\nthe network to ingest large data and files while safeguarding chain liveness.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nA number of protocol features modularize the technology stack, but the two key enablers for this\nare:\n\n* **Hierarchical consensus**: Organized *subnets*, enabling millions of users and billions of bytes.\n* **Erasure coded blob storage**: Storage and retrieval of large binary blobs through efficient\n  *alpha entanglement*.\n\n## Subnets\n\nSubnets provide a horizontally scalable, verifiable, and cost-effective data layer. The subnet\ndesign is purpose built for advanced onchain data storage patterns and use cases, similar to\non-demand horizontal scaling system in more \"traditional\" (Web 2.0) applications. These subnets\nfunction practically independently, under their own consensus, while inheriting security from their\nparent subnet. This hierarchical structure also means subnets themselves can optimize for latency,\nwhile the overall network can scale horizontally to accommodate greater throughput.\n\n## Data availability\n\nDeterministic ordering of data commitments is part of the core consensus process, but actual data\nstorage and synchronization is managed offchain—partly driven by the need to maintain chain liveness\nand limit the demands on validator resources. This system employs the\n[alpha entanglement (AE) codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02974) erasure coding scheme designed\nspecifically for distributed networks. It enhances data reliability and fault tolerance by breaking\ndown a data blob into smaller fragments and then generating additional redundant fragments.\n\nThis process encodes data fragments into a robust and **tamperproof data mesh**, and these codes\nenable efficient data recovery, reduced storage costs, decentralized repair, and data integrity, as\nwell as the ability to tie information about the **data recency and retention requirements**\n([TTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live)) into the way the data is encoded.\n\nRecall also incorporates mechanisms for proof of data access, proof of correct encoding, and a data\navailability sampling layer that leverages its unique erasure encoding system to ensure that data is\nalways accessible and retrievable by all actors on the network.\n\n## Contracts\n\nThe interface is implemented as a *contract*, deployed on a subnet. Data is represented as an\nonchain hash within a contract's state, and the actual data is stored offchain in a node's local\n(networked) block store. Spawning new buckets is handled with a general factory smart contract,\nwhich the various Recall interfaces (SDK, CLI) call under the hood.\n\nMore generally, there are two types of contracts on Recall network: ***Wasm*** contracts, and EVM\n***smart*** contracts. The two differ in how what they can handle and related intents.\n\nRecall (currently) includes two core contract primitives:\n\n* **Buckets**: Key-value object storage for arbitrary data.\n* **Timehubs**: Merklized data structures for onchain data anchoring (attestation of offchain data).\n\n### Wasm contract\n\nA *Wasm* contract is an\n[Wasm runtime contract](https://docs.filecoin.io/basics/the-blockchain/actors) used to store and\nmanage data with low-level control. The polyglot execution runtime allows Wasm contracts to be\nwritten in Rust (or other languages) and then compiled accordingly. Thus, these have more flexible\nand data-oriented programmatic control, so they're called \"Wasm contracts\" to help distinguish them\nfrom EVM smart contracts.\n\n### Smart contract\n\nA *smart* contract is a \"traditional\" EVM contract, most commonly written in Solidity. These expose\nEVM-specific types, state access, and functionality, but they lack the more robust features that a\nWasm runtime supports.\n\n## Accounts\n\nAccounts (ECDSA, secp256k1) are used to send data-carrying transactions as you would on any\nblockchain system. Thus, all mutations are onchain transactions within a subnet, so funds are\nrequired to pay for writes.\n\n### EVM addresses\n\nYou can use EVM-style (i.e., `0x` prefixed) accounts for typical wallet operations (writes, sending\ntransactions, etc.). Wasm contracts, such as buckets, are represented as hex addresses as well.\n\n### Wasm addresses\n\nAll Wasm contract addresses are represented a bit differently than your typical EVM wallet or\ncontract contract. Its usage pattern doesn't change; the format just looks *slightly* unusual.\n\nEvery Wasm contract has an unique internal chain identifier associated with it called an *actor ID*.\nYou'll see Wasm contracts are predictably represented as `0xff00...<actor_id>`. For example, a\nbucket with an ID of `143` would be `0xff0000000000000000000000000000000000008f` (since the hex\nvalue of `143` is `8f`).\n\n## Payment\n\n### Tokens\n\nTokens are used to pay for typical blockchain operations, like deploying contracts (e.g., creating a\nbucket), adding an object, or transferring funds. Whenever *data is written* to a contract and\nstored as a blob on the network, *credits* are used.\n\n<Callout>\n  You'll often see the phrase *native coin* or *native token*. A Recall subnet doesn't really \"care\"\n  what the native coin is; it simply uses the concept of a token as a medium of exchange for chain\n  transactions. In practice, the parent rootnet specifies a *supply source* upon subnet creation,\n  dictating how you move funds into or out of the subnet through deposits and withdrawals. This is\n  where the RECALL ERC20 token is used; it's the supply source on the parent chain defined for the\n  child subnet.\n</Callout>\n\n### Credits\n\nCredits are a useful mechanism to predictably manage storage costs and avoid surprises, and they are\nused to pay for all storage within the Recall network. You can sponsor (delegate) your credits to\ncontracts on the network, and whenever data is written to a contract, credits are debited from your\ncredit balance upon ongoing debit epochs (sparse block heights). It allows for more fine-grained\naccounting because 1 subnet native coin = $10^(18)$ credits.\n\nNamely, you **MUST have credits** to store data on Recall. For example, to add an object to a\nbucket, you spend credits that allocate storage space for the object, including\n[TTL](#time-to-live-ttl) parameters. Credits will automatically get withdrawn from your credit\nbalance as storage continues.\n\nYou can manage your credits with the `recall credit` command, further described in the\n[credits](/cli/commands#credits) section below.\n\n### Gas allowance\n\nWhenever you purchase credits, the number of tokens you spend will also be allocated to a *gas\nallowance* for your account. Recall that tokens are used to pay for gas. If you have a gas allowance\nbalance, you'll instead draw down from this balance. For example, if you create a bucket *and* you\nhave a gas allowance, your token balance will remain unchanged, but your gas allowance will\ndecrease. In the same example but with *no gas allowance balance*, you'll simply draw down from your\ntoken balance.\n\n## Access control\n\nAccess control is fully managed by credit workflows with approvals and revocations. You start buy\npurchasing credit with an account (i.e., wallet), and once this account creates a bucket, all object\nrelated storage operations will draw down from these credits.\n\nIf you want to enable other accounts to write to this bucket, you can use a credit *approval* to\nenable some other account to draw down from this admin account's credit balance. Revocations follow\nthe same pattern where you can revoke an approval for a provisioned account.\n\n## Broadcasting transactions\n\nCommands that write data will broadcast a transaction to the network. You'll see a\n`--broadcast-mode` flag that can be set to the following values:\n\n* `commit`: Wait until the transaction is delivered and final (note: this is the default behavior).\n* `sync`: Wait only for the result of a local transaction pre-check, but don't wait for it to be\n  delivered to all validators (i.e., added risk the transaction may fail during delivery).\n* `async`: Does not wait at all. You will not see errors in your terminal (i.e., added risk the\n  transaction may fail during delivery).\n\n## Querying state\n\nMany of the read-only commands let you pass a `--height` option to query the chain's state at a\nspecific block height. The following describes the three possible values you can use:\n\n* `committed`: The latest committed block (note: this is the default behavior).\n* `pending`: Consider pending state changes in the query.\n* `<number>`: Pass a specific block height (e.g., `123`) to fetch state from.\n\n## Time-to-live (TTL)\n\nA few operations—like uploading objects to buckets—have a time-to-live (TTL) value (denoted by the\n`--ttl` flag). It's primarily used for objects stored in buckets.\n\nThe TTL value you set represents how long the object will be stored in the network before it is\ngarbage collected and deleted. If a TTL is specified, credits will be reserved for the duration,\nafter which the object will be deleted. If a TTL is not specified, the object will be continuously\nrenewed about every hour. If the owner's free credit balance is exhausted, the object will be\ndeleted.\n\n## Chain RPCs & funds\n\nFirst, to get RECALL tokens, reach out to the Recall team.\n\nSince Recall is built on top of Filecoin, you must also have FIL in your account to interact with\nthe network if you are bridging RECALL tokens into the subnet.

state channels","description":"Data state channels and detached payloads for efficient data exchange.","category":"System Architecture and protocol design","keywords":""},"content":"Consistency in [distributed systems is a complex topic](https://docsend.com/view/gu3ywqi), and\nRecall is no exception. The network is designed to be highly available and partition tolerant, which\nmeans that the network is able to continue operating even in the event of network disruptions or\nother failures. This is achieved largely by leveraging the IPC hierarchical consensus protocol and\nmakes Recall robust to network disruptions and faults.\n\n## Data state channels\n\nEventual consistency allows subnets to \"diverge\" temporarily, but eventually arrive back to the same\nstate. For example, if a parent subnet stops being available, other subnets on the network can\ncontinue to work, albeit disconnected from the rest of the hierarchy until the parent subnet becomes\navailable. This provides availability and partition tolerance by trading consistency (in the event\nof a disruption) for eventual consistency.\n\nAs an active area of research, designing real systems with\n[provable eventual consistency](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00555588) guarantees\n[remains challenging](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01529), however the Recall system strikes a balance\nbetween\n[consistency, availability, and partition tolerance](http://pld.cs.luc.edu/courses/353/spr11/notes/brewer_keynote.pdf)\n(see [Brewer's conjecture](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/564585.564601)) by leveraging\npeer-base consensus and hierarchical checkpoints to arrive at strong eventual consistency. Another\nimportant aspect of Recall's consistency model is the use of *data state channels*, which allows the\nchain to remain \"live\", while members of a subnet synchronize over correct state in the background.\n\nState channels have emerged as a promising solution to the scalability issues of blockchains. By\nallowing transactions to occur offchain and only recording the final state onchain, state channels\ncan significantly reduce the load on the main blockchain. However, standard state channels are\nprimarily designed for financial transactions and do not cater well to scenarios involving the\nsynchronization of large, complex data sets, such as Merklized directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) or\nother verifiable data structures as employed in Recall.\n\nTo address these limitations, we introduce the concept of *data state channels*. Unlike traditional\nstate channels, data state channels are ephemeral and specifically designed to facilitate the\nsynchronization of state among a group of peers. Once all parties agree on the final commitment, the\nstate is then committed onchain. This approach is particularly useful for applications requiring\ncollaborative data synchronization and verification, such as collaborative platforms, or in our\nparticular base, decentralized storage solutions.\n\n## Data synchronization\n\nState channels are a well-established Layer 2 scaling solution for blockchains. The fundamental idea\nis to enable two or more parties to conduct multiple transactions offchain and only record the\ninitial and final states onchain. This significantly reduces the number of transactions that need to\nbe processed by the blockchain, thereby improving scalability and reducing transaction fees. Notable\nexamples include Bitcoin's Lightning network, and Ethereum's Raiden network.\n\nOutside of blockchains, data synchronization is a common problem in distributed systems. In\ndecentralized storage systems, for example, multiple nodes need to synchronize their data to ensure\nconsistency and reliability. Data synchronization in these types of systems often relies on\nstructures like Merkle trees and DAGs. These structures allow for efficient verification of data\nintegrity without requiring the entire data set to be transferred or stored. Merkle DAGs, in\nparticular, are used in various decentralized applications to ensure that data can be verified and\nsynchronized efficiently across multiple nodes.\n\nBy combining features of traditional state channels with tools for synchronizing authenticated data\nstructures, data state channels offer several advantages over other data synchronization mechanisms.\nFor example, unlike standard state channels, which are primarily designed for financial\ntransactions, Data State Channels are ephemeral and specifically geared toward synchronizing complex\ndata sets. They support structures like Merkle DAGs, making them suitable for applications involving\nlarge and verifiable data. Furthermore, Data State Channels ensure that all parties reach consensus\non the final state before committing it onchain, enhancing reliability and trust in the system.\n\nThe temporary nature of data state channels allows for quick and efficient state synchronization\nwithout the need for long-term channel maintenance. Such channels are ideal for scenarios where\nstate synchronization is needed for short-term tasks. For example, in collaborative editing,\nmultiple users can simultaneously edit a document, synchronize their changes, and commit the final\nversion onchain once consensus is reached. Similarly, in decentralized storage, peers can\nsynchronize and verify large data sets before committing the verified state onchain.\n\n### Synchronization process\n\nThe synchronization process in data state channels involves several key steps. Initially, a data\nstate channel is established by the participating peers, who agree to open the channel and lock any\nnecessary resources or funds on the blockchain. Peers then exchange data offchain, continuously\nupdating the state of the channel. Each update is verified using cryptographic proofs to ensure data\nintegrity. The process involves peers sharing hashes of the updated data along with the necessary\nMerkle proofs to verify the changes.\n\nAs data is exchanged, each peer verifies the received updates by checking the Merkle proofs against\ntheir own copy of the data structure. This ongoing verification ensures that all peers maintain a\nconsistent view of the state. Once all updates are verified and consensus is reached, the\nagreed-upon state is then committed to the blockchain by recording the final root hash.\n\n<Callout>\n  The specifics of the onchain commitment process may vary depending on the application and use case.\n  For example, in Recall the final state is committed to the blockchain by recording the final root\n  hash in the state of the target machine.\n</Callout>\n\n## End-to-end flow\n\nIn Recall, data references are represented as CIDs onchain (within a machine's state). In most\ncases, the actual data is stored *offchain*, in a node's local (networked) blockstore. The actual\nstorage layout etc is an implementation detail of the Recall node, though in practice, this\ncurrently uses an IPFS-style blockstore. During normal chain operation, nodes are instructed to\nfetch object data as part of the normal consensus process. However, the default CometBFT consensus\nprocess has no builtin mechanism to ensure that all validators (or a quorum) has actually downloaded\nthe data before the data is referenced (by CID) onchain.\n\nTo address this, Recall leverages data state channels, and the concept of a *detached payload*. A\ndetached payload is a transaction that includes a CID reference to some data, but does not include\nthe data itself. When a detached payload is added to the chain, validators leverage a data state\nchannel to synchronize the data and verify that it matches the CID reference. This ensures that all\nvalidators have a copy of the data locally, and can verify the integrity of the machine state.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Peer1\n    participant Peer2\n    participant Blockchain\n\n    Note over Blockchain: Peers receive ProcessProposal<br/>from concensus layer\n\n    Peer1->Peer2: Propose to open data state channel\n    Peer2->Peer1: Agree to open data state channel\n\n    loop Synchronize State\n        Peer1->>Peer2: Share updated data and Merkle proofs\n        Peer2->>Peer1: Verify and update state\n        Peer2->>Peer1: Share updated data and Merkle proofs\n        Peer1->>Peer2: Verify and update state\n    end\n\n    Note over Peer1,Peer2: Peers vote to confirm final state\n\n    Peer1->>Blockchain: Commit final state (Merkle DAG root hash)\n    Peer2->>Blockchain: Commit final state (Merkle DAG root hash)\n\n    Blockchain-->>Peer1: Confirm final state recorded\n    Blockchain-->>Peer2: Confirm final state recorded\n\n    Peer1->>Peer2: Close Data State Channel\n    Peer2->>Peer1: Acknowledge closure\n\n```\n\nWhen a client submits a detached payload transaction, this kicks off a background process on each\nvalidator in which they attempt to open and/or join a data state channel specifically designed to\nsynchronize that object data (see figure for a general overview of data state channel operations).\nAs far as the client/transaction is concerned, they are simply submitting a transaction. The normal\ntransaction flow is unaware (and unencumbered) by the asynchronous data exchange happening in the\nbackground.\n\nValidators leverage a *channel pool* for managing pending data state channel sync. Data resolution\nruns in the background, so as not to block items from other subnets being tried. In practice, the\ndata resolution process takes resolution tasks from the resolution pool and uses the IPLD resolver\nto fetch the content from the local node's networking layer.\n\n<Callout>\n  At the moment, the data resolution process is a simple IPFS-based process which interfaces with the\n  IPLD resolver (which itself leverages the\n  [Bitswap protocol](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/bitswap/)) to fetch the content from a local IPFS\n  node. In the future, this process will optimized to be more efficient and scalable.\n</Callout>\n\nOnce a validator has the data locally (via synchronization with its peers), the validator issues a\n*vote* to the other validators to confirm data synchronization and availability (this is similar to\nEthereum's concept of a\n[data availability committee](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-availability/#data-availability-committees)).\nDuring this time, normal block production continues.\n\n<Callout>\n  This vote-based mechanism rides on the existing voting machinery used by the core IPC process for\n  top-down parent finality. As such, it requires the top-down finality handling to be enabled in order\n  to determine if validators have enough power to vote, and to know how to calculate quorum, based on\n  said power.\n</Callout>\n\nDuring the block proposal process, validators always collect *locally* resolved objects from their\nlocal data state channel pool. In this sense, we rely on the proposer's local view of object\nresolution, rather than considering those that *might* have a quorum, but have not yet been resolved\nby *this* proposer (hence, eventual consistency). However, we maintain *strong* eventual\nconsistency, because an object in this state this will be picked up by a different proposer who\n*does* consider it resolved in a future block/cycle.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    subgraph CometBFT\n        Propose\n        Prevote\n        Precommit\n        Commit\n    end\n\n    subgraph Recall\n        ProcessProposal\n        FinalizeBlock\n    end\n\n    Propose --> ProcessProposal\n    ProcessProposal --> Prevote\n    Prevote --> Precommit\n    Precommit --> FinalizeBlock\n    FinalizeBlock --> Commit\n\n    ProcessProposal -. \"Data state\\\\nchannel process\" .-> FinalizeBlock\n\n```\n\nThe leader of a given consensus round checks the vote tally for quorum (in practice, the block\nproducer must also check onchain state for \"resolved\" as well as the in-memory vote tally), based on\nthe power table (stake) within the subnet. If a quorum is reached, the leader injects an *implicit\ntransaction* into the proposal, which is validated by the other validators based on their view of\nthe vote tally. Finally, during execution of this transaction, the object is marked as \"resolved\".\nQuerying the bucket at this point will show resolved status. The whole process is asynchronous, and\nthe object is not considered resolved until the next block.

Recall also allows it to naturally and logically shard data across\nmultiple subnets, enabling the network to scale horizontally as demand grows. Additionally, the\narrangement of data and services within unique subnets provides the key substrate upon which\nadditional innovations can be added.\n\nRecall's decentralized network is developed using the\n[Filecoin InterPlanetary Consensus (IPC) framework](https://docs.ipc.space/). IPC is a blockchain\nscaling solution and architectural design that is an alternative to existing\n[L2 scaling solutions](https://l2beat.com/) and based on the design principles of on-demand\nhorizontal scaling (similar to traditional web applications).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    %% Root network\n    Root[\"Rootnet\"]\n    class Root component\n\n    %% Relayer section\n    subgraph RelayerN[\"Relayer N\"]\n        ParentNodeN[\"Parent subnet node\"]\n        LightClientN[\"CometBFT light client\"]\n    end\n    class RelayerN relayer\n\n    %% Subnet section\n    subgraph SubnetN[\"Subnet N\"]\n        %% Consensus layer\n        CometBFTN[\"CometBFT<br/>(Consensus)\"]\n\n        %% Storage layer - moved up\n        subgraph IPLDN[\"IPLD\"]\n            StoreN[\"Store\"]\n            ResolverN[\"Resolver\"]\n        end\n\n        %% ABCI layer\n        subgraph ABCIN[\"Fendermint (ABCI++)\"]\n            subgraph MachinesN[\"Machines\"]\n                BucketN[\"Bucket\"]\n                MachineManagerN[\"Machine Manager\"]\n            end\n            ParentViewN[\"Parent View\"]\n        end\n\n        %% Internal connections\n        CometBFTN --> ABCIN --> CometBFTN\n        BucketN --> StoreN\n        StoreN <--> ResolverN\n        ABCIN --> ResolverN\n    end\n    class SubnetN subnet\n\n    %% External connections\n    Root <--\"Checkpoint\"--> RelayerN\n    RelayerN <-.\"Message passing\".-> SubnetN\n    RelayerN <--\"Checkpoint\"--> SubnetN\n```\n\n## Subnet scaling\n\nTraditional blockchains often struggle with scalability as data volume and user base increase, and\nRecall tackles this by employing a *subnet* architecture. This enables parallel processing across\nnumerous blockchains (subnets), significantly improving throughput.\n\nIPC is designed to enhance performance, decentralization, and security for decentralized\napplications by allowing permissionless creation of new blockchain subsystems called subnets. These\nsubnets are organized hierarchically, enabling seamless internal communication and reducing reliance\non cross-chain bridges, while each can employ its specific consensus algorithm and inherit security\nfrom parent subnets. This structure facilitates hosting or sharding applications based on\nperformance or cost needs.\n\nEach subnet is associated with exactly one parent. One parent can have many child subnets associated\nwith it, forming a tree structure. Child subnets periodically checkpoint information to their parent\nsubnet, and these checkpoints are propagated recursively to the rootnet. This ensures that child\nsubnets benefit from the security of their parents. Checkpoints cannot be reverted, even if trust is\nviolated in a child subnet, as long as the parent continues to operate as expected.\n\nOperators of a subnet run a full validator node for both the parent and the child subnet. Requiring\nthe nodes of child subnets to run the nodes of parents is a security parameter to ensure\ncheckpointed states of the subnet are appropriately stored, at the right time in the parent. In the\nfuture, Recall subnets will also be able to dynamically adjust their capacity by spawning temporary\nsubnets during peak usage and merging them during lower

started with basic network concepts.","category":"Getting Started with Recall, including quickstarts, faucet and portal guides, and basic concepts","keywords":""},"content":"## Memory & knowledge L2\n\nRecall puts agent data like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logs and decision making onchain, while also\nconnecting agents to *other* agents or datasets to learn from. It offers features that put it in a\nunique category compared to other blockchain or agent networks, including:\n\n* **Lightening-fast settlement & consensus**: Hierarchical subnet architecture and layered consensus\n  model that enables scalable, cost-effective storage and compute.\n* **Native data availability**: Custom built for use cases revolving around storing and managing\n  agentic and large scale data with high throughput in a decentralized fashion.\n* **Network-level access control**: Sophisticated access control mechanisms for flexible\n  monetization and data collaboration patterns.\n* **Programmable execution**: Polyglot virtual machine (VM) used to execute onchain data logic in\n  both EVM and Wasm execution runtimes with smart contracts.\n\nThe novel data availability mechanism makes it possible to store large volumes of heterogenous data,\nand the protocol consists of a few different layers to facilitate different ways to manage agent\ndata.\n\n## Buckets & blobs\n\nThe core data storage primitive is a *bucket*, which is a key-value store for arbitrary data is\nrepresented as a *blob*. You can think of the agent's external \"brain\" as being a bucket with\naccompanying features to improve its overall intelligence.\n\n## Cognition APIs\n\nRecall SDKs, APIs, and framework plugins make it easy for any agent to have their own, dedicated\nbucket that acts as a home for their data. For example, CoT logs, historical decisions, Retrieval\nAugmented Generation (RAG) documents, model generated data (like images or videos), or anything\nrelevant to the agent's decision making.\n\nDevelopers can create agents with whatever framework they want. Recall is designed to be pluggable\nso that you can drop it into your existing workflows and gain visibility into the agent's decision\nmaking process. Since all data is stored onchain, it provides a view into your—or other—agents'\nknowledge and memory, making it possible to inspect the agent's reasoning and share knowledge with\nothers.\n\n## Contracts\n\n*Contracts* are arbitrary programs that run on the network, written for either EVM (Solidity) or\nWasm (Rust, etc.) execution. They provide the interface for reading and writing data, giving agents\na way to permissionlessly create, manage, and share their knowledge.\n\n## Accounts\n\nLike any blockchain system, *accounts* are used to interact with the network. All transactions are\nsigned by an EVM-style key pair (ECDSA, secp256k1) to ensure that the transaction is authentic,\nauthorized, and verifiable. Accounts pay for network operations with tokens and credits.\n\n## Tokens\n\nThe RECALL token is used to pay for network usage. For example, when you create a bucket or send\ntransactions, you pay gas fees in the token. However, when you *store* data on the network, you pay\nin credits, which are a unit of resource to perform a set of operations.\n\n## Credit\n\nRecall employs a novel *credit* system to support usage-based pricing and predictable costs,\npurchased with tokens. For example, storing an arbitrary blob for a defined amount of time costs a\nforecastable number of credits, measured by the size of the data, the duration of the storage, and\nthe computational complexity of data processing.\n\n## Virtual gas\n\nBuying credits ensures users can pre-buy storage to that can be drawn down at a predictable rate.\n*Virtual gas* is the counterpart to this equation, also known as an account's *gas allowance*,\nequivalent to the number of tokens used to purchase credits. When you pay for gas operations, it\neither draws down from your virtual gas balance, or uses your actual token balance if there is no\ngas allowance available.\n\n## Operator approvals\n\nAccess to writing data is managed by *credit approvals* and *sponsors* (account operators). An\naccount that owns credit can authorize other accounts to use and draw down from its balance, and an\napproved account can set its default sponsor to authorizing operator. This allows you to set up\nmulti-tiered collaboration and access control patterns.\n\n## Functions\n\nAt its core, *functions* are fundamental building blocks for task execution on the network. These\nare implemented with Wasm-defined logic and can be thought of as a single, atomic unit of work that\ncan be executed onchain.\n\nThe core data storage primitive is a *blob* function, which tracks opcode usage and reports gas\nspend for tasks such as downloading input data, erasure coding outputs for blob storage, and more.\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n  All subsequent layers are built on top of functions. Currently, the only function available is the\n  blob, but others will be added in the future (e.g., compute for performing transformations).\n</Callout>\n\n## Limits\n\nThere are a few limitations to be aware of when building on Recall. Keep in mind that services like\nRecall and Ceramic have their own constraints, which are detailed in their respective sections.\n\n* **Block time**: \\~1 block per second.\n* **Throughput (TPS)**: Hundreds of transactions per second.\n* **Maximum blob size**: 5 GiB.\n\n<Callout type=\"warn\">\n  Note: TPS is rough estimate and may vary based on network conditions.

It sends **5\nRECALL** to your wallet, and note it has builtin rate limiting to prevent abuse.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step>\n    ### Faucet sign in\n\n    First, head to faucet at: [https://faucet.recall.network](https://faucet.recall.network). It should\n    verify you're not a bot through Cloudflare protections.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step>\n    ### Request funds\n\n    Input your wallet address and click `Request RECALL`. It should take a matter of seconds before the\n    funds are available in your account, and upon success, a notification will show the transaction\n    hash.\n\n    ![Faucet](/img/faucet/demo.gif)\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step>\n    ### Start building\n\n    Now that you have funds in your wallet, you're all set to start building on Recall, such as\n    purchasing credit or storing data!

agents that learn and evolve through stateful memory and collaborative interactions.","category":"Getting Started with Recall, including quickstarts, faucet and portal guides, and basic concepts","keywords":""},"content":"## What is Recall?\n\nRecall is an *intelligence network* that transforms how agents secure, publish, and monetize their\nmemories and intelligence, powered by a blockchain L2 design for agents and large scale data. By\nputting memory onchain, Recall enables agents to become more autonomous, self-sustaining, and\ncollaborative entities, paving the way for a new era of AI evolution.\n\n## Why Recall?\n\nIn today's ecosystem, agents struggle to verify their identity without exposing their reasoning,\nwhich is crucial in a trustless, onchain environment. By putting reasoning onchain, agents can\nshowcase when ideas were formed and executed. Additionally, agents lack a secure, onchain substrate\nfor distributing or monetizing valuable assets—from research to historical decisions and model\noutputs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    subgraph \"Agent improvement & collaboration\"\n        %% Core Recall Node\n        Agents --> R[Recall]\n\n        %% Capabilities\n        R -->|Verify| V[✓]\n        R -->|Trade| T[$]\n\n        %% Agent Improvement Loop\n        R -->|Thoughts| S[🧠]\n        R -->|Memories| M[💭]\n        R -->|Knowledge| C[📈]\n\n        %% Improvement Cycle\n        S & M & C --> L[Improve]\n        L --> Agents\n    end\n```\n\nRecall unifies these aspects by providing a comprehensive system for knowledge, reasoning, memory,\nand data storage tailored for crypto and AI agents. It also offers developers a portal into their\nagent's cognitive processes, allowing them to review and verify decisions. Recall enhances the value\nof knowledge graphs, fostering collaboration and transforming how intelligence is exchanged and\nmonetized.\n\n## For developers\n\nRecall offers a robust platform to manage your agent's most valuable resources, providing tools to\nsecurely store data and selectively publish content to foster community growth, trust, and\nverification. The agent integration frameworks, agent memory L2, and memory portal app offer\ndevelopers unprecedented capabilities to monitor, improve, and attract followers to their\nagents—showcasing the potential quality and value of their outputs.\n\n## For crypto enthusiasts\n\nSupporting and engaging with crypto agents that can be trusted and verified is crucial. Recall\nenables agents to transparently showcase their thinking and decision-making processes without\nsharing every detail, building trust and understanding.

web-based interface for interacting with Recall. It lets you connect your wallet and\ninspect relevant information about your accounts, such as bucket, token, and credit information.\nAdditionally, you can create approvals to delegate access to your account—which is particularly\nuseful for delegating access to an agent.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step>\n    ## Account setup\n\n    To get started, you'll need to have an account set up in your browser wallet. If you don't have an\n    existing private key, the `recall account create` [command](/advanced/cli/account#create-an-account)\n    can generate one for you, locally.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step>\n    ## Get testnet tokens\n\n    Before interacting with the Portal, make sure you have some testnet tokens—follow the\n    [faucet](/intro/faucet) guide if you haven't already received some.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step>\n    ## Enter the Portal & connect\n\n    Then, head to the [Portal](https://portal.recall.network) to get started. Once you have an account\n    set up, you can connect it to the Portal by clicking the `Connect Wallet` button in the top right\n    corner of the screen.\n\n    ![Connect Wallet](/img/portal/landing.png)\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step>\n    ## Buy credits\n\n    Navigate to the `Credit` tab. Here, you'll see your account information, including your token and\n    credit balance. Click the `Buy Credits` button, and enter the amount you'd like to purchase. This\n    will swap RECALL tokens for the allotment, defined in GB per month.\n\n    ![Buy Credits](/img/portal/account.png)\n\n    Now that you have purchased credits, you should see your account information displayed, including\n    your token and credit balance. Tokens let you create buckets, while credits let you store data.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step>\n    ## Account approvals\n\n    Optionally, navigate to the `Approvals Granted` tab, click the `New Approval` button, and enter the\n    address to approve.

EVM compatible. You can deploy smart contracts as you would on any other chain, but\nmany of the true unlocks are at the underlying Wasm runtime. Regardless, most of the EVM RPC calls\nare supported.\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n  Make sure you *do not* use the Cancun EVM version. This adds transient storage opcodes, which\n  currently are not supported. Instead, use the Paris EVM version.\n</Callout>\n\n## Base URL\n\nThe EVM API endpoints for each of the Recall chain environments are listed below:\n\n* `testnet`: `https://evm.node-0.testnet.recall.network`\n* `localnet` or `devnet`: `http://127.0.0.1:8645`\n\nThe parent chain RPCs for Recall are the following. These are only relevant if you're working with\ncross chain operations (e.g., deposits or withdrawals) or validator actions (i.e., node operator\nactions).\n\n* `testnet`: Uses Filecoin Calibration (e.g., `https://api.calibration.node.glif.io/rpc/v1`)\n* `localnet`: Uses Anvil (`http://127.0.0.1:8545`)\n\n## Endpoints\n\n* `eth_accounts`\n* `eth_blockNumber`\n* `eth_chainId`\n* `eth_getBalance`\n* `eth_getUncleCountByBlockHash`\n* `eth_getUncleCountByBlockNumber`\n* `eth_getUncleByBlockHashAndIndex`\n* `eth_getUncleByBlockNumberAndIndex`\n* `eth_getTransactionCount`\n* `eth_gasPrice`\n* `eth_getBlockByHash`\n* `eth_getBlockByNumber`\n* `eth_getTransactionByHash`\n* `eth_getTransactionReceipt`\n* `eth_feeHistory`\n* `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas`\n* `eth_sendRawTransaction`\n* `eth_call`\n* `eth_estimateGas`\n* `eth_getBlockReceipts`\n* `eth_getStorageAt`\n* `eth_getCode`\n* `eth_syncing`\n* `web3_clientVersion`\n* `eth_getLogs`\n* `eth_newFilter`\n* `eth_newBlockFilter`\n* `eth_newPendingTransactionFilter`\n* `eth_getFilterChanges`\n* `eth_uninstallFilter`\n* `eth_subscribe`\n* `eth_unsubscribe`\n\nThe following are not supported:\n\n* `eth_createAccessList`\n* `eth_coinbase`\n* `eth_compileLLL`\n* `eth_compileSerpent`\n* `eth_compileSolidity`\n* `eth_getCompilers`\n* `eth_getProof`\n* `eth_getWork`\n* `eth_hashrate`\n* `eth_mining`\n* `eth_sendTransaction`\n* `eth_sign`\n* `eth_signTransaction`\n* `eth_submitHashrate`\n* `eth_submitWork`\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n  If there are any RPCs you're looking for that are not listed here, please let us know!\n</Callout>\n\n## Gas settings\n\nWhen you deploy to a subnet, the default gas parameters used may be too low, leading to problems. If\nyou run into this issue, EVM libraries give you the ability to override the gas settings.\n\nFor example, with `forge` where `-g` is shorthand for `--gas-estimate-multiplier`:\n\n```\nforge script ... -g 100000\n```\n\nThis will increase the estimate multiplier to `100000`, which overrides the default of

API","description":"Endpoints for interacting with the Recall network's object API.","category":"Network APIs for low-level EVM, objects, and CometBFT consensus","keywords":""},"content":"The object API exposes a set of endpoints for interacting with the Recall network's blob storage.\nBuckets are an abstraction around blobs the help you manage these blobs. Under the hood, Recall\nnodes use [Iroh](https://www.iroh.computer/) and expose the HTTP API to allow anyone to upload\nsigned data to the Recall network.\n\n### Base URL\n\nThe object API endpoints for each of the Recall chain environments are listed below:\n\n* `testnet`: `https://objects.node-0.testnet.recall.network`\n* `localnet` or `devnet`: `http://127.0.0.1:8001`\n\n## Endpoints\n\n* `GET /health`: Check the health of the node.\n* `GET /v1/node`: Get information about the node.\n* `POST /v1/objects`: Create a new bucket.\n* `GET /v1/objects/<bucket>/<object_key>`: Download an object from a bucket.\n\n## Node health\n\n### `GET /health`\n\nThe node health endpoint is used to check the health of the node. It returns a `200` status code if\nthe node is healthy.\n\n### Example\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET http://localhost:8001/health\n```\n\n## Node information\n\n### `GET /v1/node`\n\nThe node information endpoint is used to get information about the node, particularly, with respect\nto Iroh. It lists the node's ID (a public key, base32 encoded), relay URL, and the set of direct\naddresses it is connected to.\n\n### Example\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET http://localhost:8001/v1/node\n```\n\nIt returns a JSON object with the following fields:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"node_id\": \"3jlwzcxgdd25z5uun3skbqiottw44s3t5tpl2nwsugo3nujsqw6q\",\n  \"info\": {\n    \"relay_url\": \"https://staging-use1-1.relay.iroh.network./\",\n    \"direct_addresses\": [\"172.18.0.3:11204\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen you upload data to the Recall network, you will need to know the information above to properly\nstage your data for the asynchronous-sync transaction and data upload process.\n\n## Downloading an object\n\n### `GET /v1/objects/<bucket>/<object_key>`\n\nThe object download endpoint is used to download an object from a bucket.\n\n### Example\n\nWe'll set an environment variable for the bucket and object key.\n\n```bash\nexport BUCKET=\"0xff000000000000000000000000000000000000ac\"\nexport OBJECT_KEY=\"hello/world\"\n```\n\nThen, we'll download the object, passing in the bucket and object key.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET http://localhost:8001/v1/objects/$BUCKET/$OBJECT_KEY > downloaded.txt\n```\n\nNote the the contents will be written to stdout unless you redirect it to a file.\n\n## Uploading an object\n\n### `POST /v1/objects`\n\nThe object upload endpoint is a two step process. It is best recommended to avoid using this API\ndirectly and, instead, use the Recall CLI, SDK, or other clients that help you manage the process.\n\nThe upload endpoint is designed to accept multipart form data with the following fields:\n\n* `chain_id`: The chain ID for Recall.\n* `msg`: The signed message to upload. This accepts either an EVM EIP-1559 signed transaction, or an\n  FVM signed message, where the bytes are encoded as a base64 string.\n* `hash`: The blake3 hash of the object.\n* `size`: The size of the object, in bytes.\n* `source`: The Iroh source node ID.\n\nIf you do want to use this API directly, you can do so by following the steps below:\n\n1. Get node information from the `/v1/node` endpoint.\n2. Calculate the blake3 hash of the object.\n3. Calculate the size of the object, in bytes.\n4. Create a signed message from the EVM EIP-1559 signed transaction or FVM signed message, and then\n   base64 encode it.\n5. Create a multipart form data request.\n6. Upload the form data to the endpoint.\n\nBelow is an example where we have set the environment variables for the chain ID, signed message,\nand source node ID. The `hash` corresponds to a simple file with contents `hello\\n`, and the\n`source` is shown for demonstration purposes. Note a validator's API expects the `source` ID to be\ndifferent than its own node ID. Thus, this staging process will require you run some in-memory or\npersistent Iroh node in the background.\n\n```\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8001/v1/objects \\\n  -F \"chain_id=$CHAIN_ID\" \\\n  -F \"msg=$MSG\" \\\n  -F \"hash=rzghyg4z3p6vbz5jkgc75lk64fci7kieul65o6hk6xznx7lctkmq\" \\\n  -F \"size=6\" \\\n  -F \"source=r4md6oqwcbb2my4jkjqnah2yhvcvyjhefdmdruoiknawuedg2kja\"\n```\n\nThis will return the following, which confirms the object was uploaded successfully:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"hash\": \"rzghyg4z3p6vbz5jkgc75lk64fci7kieul65o6hk6xznx7lctkmq\",\n  \"metadata_hash\": \"layatwp4aemy3mavbdogxspg6effz34runowi3ltuw32qgonwbgq\"\n}\n```\n\nThe `metadata_hash` is a blake3 hash used by Recall for data availability and recovery purposes.\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n  We'll put out more detailed examples for how to do this in the future.

started with Recall node development and deployment.","category":"Node Operators guides for running a Recall node or developing locally","keywords":""},"content":"<Callout type=\"warn\">\n  Recall is a public testnet. It is currently *permissioned*, meaning only authorized nodes can\n  participate in the network, but we will open this up more broadly in the future. If you are\n  interested in participating in the network, please reach out!\n</Callout>\n\n## Hardware requirements\n\nTo run a Recall node, we ***strongly*** recommend the following hardware. However, these values are\nsubject to change based on network optimizations, the number of nodes, and learnings as the network\nprogresses toward mainnet.\n\n| Hardware          | Testnet | Mainnet (not live) |\n| ----------------- | ------- | ------------------ |\n| CPU cores         | 8       | 8                  |\n| Memory            | 32 (GB) | 32 (GB)            |\n| Disk space (1)    | 32 (TB) | 480 (TB)           |\n| Network bandwidth | 1 GB/s  | 1 GB/s             |\n| Public IP Address | 1       | 1                  |\n\n## Parent-child nodes\n\nRecall leverages a parent-child subnet architecture. Operators of a subnet **must** run a full\nvalidator node for **both the parent and the child subnet**. In the future, Recall subnets will also\nbe able to dynamically adjust their capacity by spawning temporary subnets during peak usage and\nmerging them during lower activity.\n\nHowever, today, there

a local subnet","description":"Leverage a Dockerized multi-node setup for development.","category":"Node Operators guides for running a Recall node or developing locally","keywords":""},"content":"This page walks through how to spin up a local Recall network with either Docker (`localnet`) or on\nyour machine (`devnet`) and presumes you've done the steps described in the preceding\n[setup page](/operators/setup).\n\n## Localnet\n\nThe following outlines how to run a localnet with Docker. It assumes you've already installed the\nprerequisites and also are in the root of the `ipc` repo.\n\n### Docker\n\nAll scripts use `cargo make` to start Docker containers, volumes, and a Docker network. Before\ngetting started, make sure that Docker is running by checking the status of the Docker daemon:\n\n```sh\ndocker ps\n```\n\nIf it's not running, start it:\n\n<Tabs items={[\"macOS\", \"Linux\"]}>\n  <Tab value=\"macOS\">\n    Make sure the [Docker Desktop app](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) is installed, and then open it.\n\n    ```sh\n    open /Applications/Docker.app\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab value=\"Linux\">\n    Use `systemctl` to start the daemon.\n\n    ```sh\n    sudo systemctl start docker\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\nMake sure you're currently in the `ipc` repository's root directory (from the previous setup and\ninstallation step). We'll be running the local network from the `scripts` folder.\n\nAll scripts use `cargo make` to start docker containers, volumes, and a docker network. You can use\n`docker ps` to check the status of each container. Also, you **must** run the scripts from the root\nof the repo!\n\n### Startup & shutdown\n\nA localnet deployments will create a subnet with `anvil` as the rootnet (parent). The scripts will\nhandle localnet validator keys (using the standard `anvil` accounts) and configs in the config\nfolder (defaults to `~/.ipc`). In the root of the `ipc` repo, you can run the localnet with the\nfollowing `Makefile` command:\n\n```shell\nmake run-localnet\n```\n\nAlternatively, the `deploy.sh` can be ran directly. The key callout here is that you **must**\nspecify `localnet` (or `local`) as the argument, and it's *not* possible to pass a specific branch\nas an argument (i.e., it uses whatever branch is currently checked out in the local repo).\n\n```shell\n./scripts/deploy_subnet/deploy.sh localnet\n```\n\nIf you want to, for example, skip the build and dependency installation steps, you can do so with:\n\n```shell\nSKIP_BUILD=true SKIP_DEPENDENCIES=true ./scripts/deploy_subnet/deploy.sh localnet\n```\n\nLastly, if you're ready to stop the network, you can run `stop_local.sh`:\n\n```shell\n./scripts/deploy_subnet/stop_local.sh\n```\n\nAlso optional is the `recall` CLI, which (if installed) will pre-buy credits for all accounts in the\nlocalnet subnet setup. Follow the instructions in the `rust-recall` repo to install it:\n[here](https://github.com/recallnet/rust-recall).\n\nThe following outlines general observations for how long the localnet deployment process takes and\nvarious metrics:\n\n* Deploy + build images: \\~7 minutes\n* Deploy with prebuilt images: \\~5 minutes (i.e., `SKIP_BUILD=true`)\n* Blocks: \\~1 per second\n* Topdown messages: \\~2 minutes (e.g., depositing funds from the rootnet)\n* Bottomup messages: \\~15 seconds\n* Stopping the network: \\~40–45 seconds\n\n### Logging\n\nDeploying a network will log various steps and summary information to the console, including the RPC\nURLs and contracts. If you're running a localnet, it'll also show the available accounts, private\nkeys, and respective balances.\n\nOnce the startup process is complete, each Docker container will also log its own information to the\nconsole.\n\n### Docker containers\n\nUse `docker ps` to list the network's containers. Each validator has six containers, and there are a\nfew others used across the full network.\n\nYou can check a validator's logs with `docker logs <container-name>`. The following containers are\ncreated (as shown for validator `0`), and you can replace the `0` with `1` or `2` to inspect the\nother validators:\n\n* `validator-0-fendermint`\n* `validator-0-cometbft`\n* `validator-0-promtail`\n* `validator-0-objects`\n* `validator-0-ethapi`\n* `validator-0-iroh`\n* `prometheus`\n* `grafana`\n* `anvil`\n* `loki`\n\n### Usage\n\nYou can test using the subnet with the\n[`recall` SDK & CLI](https://github.com/recallnet/rust-recall). Keys *are not* logged if you're\nrunning a testnet. For localnet, keys *are* logged with their corresponding balances. You'll notice\nthe first three accounts correspond to the validators and marked as reserved. If you're trying to do\nnon-validator actions (e.g., create a bucket or timehub), it's best to avoid these accounts since\nnonce race conditions can occur.\n\n```txt\nAccount balances:\nParent native: 10000 ETH\nParent RECALL: 100 RECALL\nSubnet native: 5000 RECALL\nSubnet credits: 5000000000000000000000\n\nAccounts:\n(0) 0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266 (reserved)\n(1) 0x70997970c51812dc3a010c7d01b50e0d17dc79c8 (reserved)\n(2) 0x3c44cdddb6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12fa4293bc (reserved)\n(3) 0x90f79bf6eb2c4f870365e785982e1f101e93b906 (available)\n...\n\nPrivate keys:\n(0) ac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80\n(1) 59c6995e998f97a5a0044966f0945389dc9e86dae88c7a8412f4603b6b78690d\n(2) 5de4111afa1a4b94908f83103eb1f1706367c2e68ca870fc3fb9a804cdab365a\n(3) 7c852118294e51e653712a81e05800f419141751be58f605c371e15141b007a6\n...\n```\n\nYou can use then these keys with the `recall` SDK and CLI by creating an `.env` file and sourcing\nit, or by setting the variables in your shell. Keep in mind a `NETWORK` variable is used by\n`fendermint` and `ipc-cli` but with a different value, so it's best to use separate terminal windows\nwhen using the `recall` CLI alongside the others.\n\n```dotenv\nexport RECALL_NETWORK=localnet\nexport RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY=<private_key>\n```\n\nYou can now use `recall` as normal, e.g., `recall account deposit`, `recall os create`, etc.\nSimilarly, the SDK lets you use the `localnet` by explicitly initializing it with\n`recall_sdk::network::Network::Localnet.init()`.\n\nWhen developing locally, it's ideal to use the `localnet` setup in the `deploy_subnet` directory.\nBut `devnet` is much faster to set up and teardown since it doesn't require building Docker images\nor running any networked services, and instead, relies on installed binaries.\n\n## Devnet\n\nThe devnet requires you run multiple services manually and have the binaries installed on your host\nmachine. At a minimum, you'll need to install CometBFT, Fendermint, and Iroh. Optionally, you can\nalso install the EVM RPC service, in case you want to interact with the devnet via EVM RPCs (e.g.,\ndeploying Solidity contracts).\n\n### Build dependencies\n\nThe following assumes you're working in the root of the `ipc` repo, and **not** in this `scripts`\ndirectory.\n\n#### CometBFT\n\nNavigate outside this repo and install CometBFT (note: you **must** install v0.37.1 since the latest\nversion is not compatible with the rest of the codebase):\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft.git\ncd cometbft\ngit checkout v0.37.1\nmake install\n```\n\n#### Fendermint & IPC CLI\n\nThe default `make` task will build the contracts, libraries, and CLIs needed to run a `devnet`.\n\n```\nmake\n```\n\n### Running the devnet\n\n#### Setup\n\nFirst, configure the `devnet` with the following, which creates some keys and alters the\nconfiguration located in `~/.fendermint`:\n\n```\nmake config-devnet\n```\n\nThe keys used here are a bit different from how the `localnet` setup works. The `localnet` relies on\nthe `ipc-cli` for much of its logic, whereas the `devnet` relies primarily on the `fendermint` CLI.\n\n#### Accounts\n\nThe keys you'll use can be found in the `test-network/keys` directory within this `scripts` folder.\nOnly the `alice` key is deterministically coded into the Fendermint startup process. You can export\nany of the keys to a hex encoded EVM format.\n\nFrom the root of this repo, run the following command, replacing `alice.sk` with the corresponding\nfilename and `alice_eth` with a desired name (for files that get created later):\n\n```\nfendermint key into-eth --secret-key ./scripts/test-network/keys/alice.sk --name alice_eth\n```\n\nSince the `alice.sk` will always be the same, the following is consistent across machines and can be\nused for `devnet` interactions (e.g., creating buckets, timehubs, writing data, etc.):\n\n* EVM address: `0xc05fe6b63ffa4b3c518e6ff1e597358ee839db01`\n* Hex private key: `1c323d494d1d069fe4c891350a1ec691c4216c17418a0cb3c7533b143bd2b812`\n\n#### Startup & shutdown\n\nFinally, start all the services in separate terminal windows in the following order. The associated\nendpoints are shown below.\n\n1. Iroh: `http://127.0.0.1:4919`\n\n```\nmake run-devnet-iroh\n```\n\n2. Objects API: `http://127.0.0.8001`\n\n```\nmake run-devnet-objects\n```\n\n3. Fendermint: `http://127.0.0.1:26658`\n\n```\nmake run-devnet-fendermint\n```\n\n4. CometBFT: `http://127.0.0.1:26657`\n\n```\nmake run-devnet-cometbft\n```\n\n5. EVM RPC: `http://127.0.0.1:8545` (this is optional)\n\n```\nmake run-devnet-evm\n```\n\nOnce these are running, you should be able to interact with the `devnet` and *most* of the expected\nfunctionality. One thing to be aware of: there's no parent (rootnet), so certain parts of the\nprotocol (like Solidity contracts) don't happen automatically.\n\nLastly, keep in mind that if you ever make changes to the core `ipc` codebase and want the devnet to\nuse these changes, you'll need to shut these services down (i.e., exit the processes), run `make`,\nand then `make config-devnet` again.\n\n### Usage\n\nIf you're using the `recall` CLI, you must set the `RECALL_NETWORK` environment variable to `devnet`\nin order to use it. Note that `fendermint` `ipc-cli` the `NETWORK` flag but with different target\nfunctionality, so be sure the `RECALL_` prefix is attached.\n\n```\nexport RECALL_NETWORK=devnet\nexport RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY=1c323d494d1d069fe4c891350a1ec691c4216c17418a0cb3c7533b143bd2b812\n```\n\nSimilarly, you'll use the `devnet` in the SDK where

& installation","description":"Install prerequisites and build the Recall binaries.","category":"Node Operators guides for running a Recall node or developing locally","keywords":""},"content":"This page outlines how to install the necessary dependencies that precede building and installing\nthe underlying Recall binaries. If you already have these installed on your machine, you can proceed\nto the [local development](/operators/local) page.\n\n## Background\n\nThere are two primary ways to use these scripts:\n\n1. Run a local network with three nodes and Anvil as the root chain (`localnet`).\n2. Run a local network without any root chain (`devnet`).\n\nOption (1) leverages Dockerized instances of Iroh, Fendermint, CometBFT, and ancillary services. All\nof this logic is located in the `scripts` directory. Option (2) requires you to have various\ndependencies running directly on your host machine, so there's a bit of manual setup required.\n\n## Installation\n\nClone the `ipc` repo and build the project:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/recallnet/ipc\ncd ipc\nmake\n```\n\nThis will generate the `ipc-cli` and `fendermint` binaries in the `target/release/` directory.\n\n## Usage\n\nRegardless of the target development environment (`localnet` or `devnet`), there are a handful of\nbuild dependencies you'll need to install on your machine to run the scripts.\n\n### Build dependencies\n\nYou'll need the following dependencies installed on your machine:\n\n* `rustup`\n* `cargo make`\n* `toml-cli`\n* `foundry`\n* `node`\n* `docker`\n* `jq`\n\nIf you run the localnet's `scripts/deploy_subnet/deploy.sh` script, it *will* check for the\nexistence of these dependencies. For Linux machines, the script *will also* handle installation for\nall build dependencies. For macOS, it *will not* automatically install them. Instead, you'll have to\ndo this manually, but the script *will* log and let you know what you're missing before proceeding.\nThe section below outlines how to do this for macOS.\n\n#### Linux\n\nThe `scripts/deploy_subnet/deploy.sh` script will handle all the build dependencies for a Linux\nmachine. Note this is specific to the `localnet` environment, and not the `devnet` environment, but\nthe dependencies are generally the same.\n\n#### MacOS\n\nYou'll need to install the following dependencies if they are not already available:\n\n* Xcode from App Store or terminal: `xcode-select --install`\n\n* Homebrew: Required for installing `jq` and possibly other dependencies. See the official Homebrew\n  docs [here](https://brew.sh/) (but it's probably already installed).\n\n* `docker`: Required to run the Dockerized nodes. See the official Docker docs\n  [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install).\n\n* `jq`: Needed for much of the JSON parsing logic when working with configuration files.\n\n  ```shell\n  brew install jq\n  ```\n\n* `rustup`: Required for building the Docker images (i.e., most of the stack is written in Rust).\n  See the official Rust docs [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and make sure `cargo`\n  gets installed.\n\n  ```shell\n  curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y\n  ```\n\n* `cargo make`: Required for building the Docker images.\n\n  ```shell\n  cargo install cargo-make\n  ```\n\n* `toml-cli`: Needed for reading and writing various configuration files used by Docker images.\n\n  ```shell\n  cargo install toml-cli\n  ```\n\n* `foundryup`: Used for various onchain operations. See the official Foundry docs\n  [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) and make sure `cast` gets\n  installed.\n\n  ```shell\n  curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash\n  foundryup\n  ```\n\n* Node.js: Needed for compiling and deploying contracts with Hardhat. See the official Node.js docs\n  [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download)—or use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (described\n  below for `bash` shells).\n\n  ```shell\n  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash\n  source \"$HOME/.bashrc\" # This step will vary by OS\n  nvm install --default lts/*\n  ```\n\n### Environment variables\n\nAll logic handled in the `scripts/deploy_subnet/deploy.sh` script uses the following environment\nvariables, which are defined in the `env.example` file. For localnet deployments, you won't need to\nset any of the above. There are also two additional optional variables:\n\n* `SKIP_DEPENDENCIES`: Skips the installation of build dependencies.\n* `SKIP_BUILD`: Skips the build step for the entire stack. You **MUST** run this at least once\n  before starting the network. Notably, this also installs the `ipc-cli` binary that is used heavily\n  during the deployment script. After doing so, future `deploy.sh` invocations will use the existing\n  build artifacts, so you can set `SKIP_BUILD=true` to save time.\n* `FM_LOG_LEVEL`: Fendermint log level. Defaults to `info`.\n* `FM_LOG_DOMAINS`: Fendermint log domains. Defaults to\n  `Bottomup,Consensus,Execution,Mpool,System,Topdown`.\n* `RELAYER_LOG_LEVEL`: Relayer log level. Defaults to `info`.\n\nCreate a `.env` file with your desired values and source it in your shell:\n\n```shell\nsource .env\n```\n\nLastly, be sure to source your shell's rc file. This step will vary by OS. For example, `bash`:\n\n```shell\nsource ${HOME}/.bashrc\n```\n\nNote the `deploy.sh` script is also configured to deploy to Filecoin Calibration. There's really no\nneed to use it there, but the following environment variables dictate what contracts are deployed\nduring the deployment flow:\n\n* `IPC_FOLDER`: The path to the IPC folder (localnet deployments will use the root `ipc` path; else,\n  it defaults to `${HOME}/ipc`).\n* `PARENT_GATEWAY_ADDRESS`: The EVM address of the parent gateway contract (default defined in\n  `.ipc-cal/config.toml` or `.ipc-local/config.toml`).\n* `PARENT_REGISTRY_ADDRESS`: The EVM address of the parent registry contract (default defined in\n  `.ipc-cal/config.toml` or

`bucket` subcommand (aliased as `bu`) has the following subcommands:\n\n* `create`: Create a new bucket contract.\n* `list`: List buckets by owner in a subnet.\n* `add`: Add an object into the bucket.\n* `get`: Get an object from the bucket.\n* `delete`: Delete an object from the bucket.\n* `query`: Query objects in the bucket.\n* `metadata`: Set new metadata for an object.\n\nWhen you create objects, the `key` is a custom identifier that, by default, uses the `/` delimiter\nto create a key-based hierarchy. The value is the data you want to store, which can be a file path.\nA best practice is to decide on a key naming convention that makes sense for your data, such as\n`<namespace>/<id>` or similar. The hierarchical structure of the key allows for easy retrieval of\ndata by prefixes, which is explained below (see the `query` subcommand).\n\n## Create\n\nCreate a new Bucket contract.\n\n```\nrecall bucket create\n```\n\n| Flag                | Required? | Description                                                               |\n| ------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `-p, --private-key` | Yes       | Wallet private key (ECDSA, secp256k1) for signing transactions.           |\n| `-m, --metadata`    | No        | User-defined metadata.                                                    |\n| `--buy-credit`      | No        | The amount of tokens to spend on credit for the bucket.                   |\n| `--gas-limit`       | No        | Gas limit for the transaction.                                            |\n| `--gas-fee-cap`     | No        | Maximum gas fee for the transaction in attoFIL (1FIL = 10\\*\\*18 attoFIL). |\n| `--gas-premium`     | No        | Gas premium for the transaction in attoFIL (1FIL = 10\\*\\*18 attoFIL).     |\n| `--sequence`        | No        | Sequence (i.e., nonce) for the transaction.                               |\n\n**Example:**\n\nCreate a new bucket contract.\n\n```sh\nrecall bucket create\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"address\": \"0xff0000000000000000000000000000000000008f\",\n  \"tx\": {\n    \"transactionHash\": \"0xab575c9ac1c175b4c5ebd2951c6819a960f4ac917083960ae1320b3f042c5aed\",\n    \"transactionIndex\": \"0x0\",\n    \"blockHash\": \"0x8ad132d45814732626fb1537bc6c9bbb51e930b22b209807f05315a5425240a2\",\n    \"blockNumber\": \"0x3ef0\",\n    \"from\": \"0x90f79bf6eb2c4f870365e785982e1f101e93b906\",\n    \"to\": \"0xff00000000000000000000000000000000000011\",\n    \"cumulativeGasUsed\": \"0x134fb57\",\n    \"gasUsed\": \"0x134fb57\",\n    \"contractAddress\": null,\n    \"logs\": [],\n    \"status\": \"0x1\",\n    \"root\": \"0x22aef53ff99dde1ddd59e244cd4dd6531833e41045f3a98ee0d69e52f143b18d\",\n    \"logsBloom\": \"0x00...\",\n    \"type\": \"0x2\",\n    \"effectiveGasPrice\": \"0x8\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCreate a new bucket contract with metadata.\n\n```sh\nrecall bucket create --metadata \"alias=foo\"\n```\n\n## List buckets\n\nList buckets by owner in a subnet.\n\n```sh\nrecall bucket list {--private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> | --address <ADDRESS>}\n```\n\nYou must pass *either* the `--private-key` or `--address` flag.

command line interface to interact with the Recall network.","category":"Advanced Topics, including SDKs, CLIs, S3 adapters, etc.","keywords":"cli, command line interface, recall cli"},"content":"The Recall CLI is a command-line interface for interacting with the Recall network. It allows you to\nmanage your accounts, interact with smart contracts, and manage your data that gets stored on the\nnetwork.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step>\n    ## Installation\n\n    You'll need to download the source code, build, and install the CLI.\n\n    ```sh\n    git clone https://github.com/recallnet/rust-recall.git\n    cd rust-recall\n    make install\n    ```\n\n    Once installed, you can run the `recall` command from your terminal.\n\n    ```sh\n    recall --help\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step>\n    ## Configure environment variables\n\n    The following environment variables are required for the majority of the `recall` subcommands:\n\n    * `RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY`: A wallet private key (ECDSA, secp256k1) for signing transactions.\n    * `RECALL_NETWORK`: Specify the chain location with RPC presets and settings that map to either\n      `mainnet` (not available), `testnet` (default), `localnet`, or `devnet`.\n\n    These can be overridden with the flags `--private-key` and `--network`, respectively.\n\n    As a best practice, you should create a `.env` file with the following and run source it to ensure\n    the binary loads these variables. The default network is `testnet`, so it's not necessary to set the\n    network variable unless you're developing elsewhere (e.g., local development uses `localnet`).\n\n    ```txt title=\".env\"\n    export RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key\n    export RECALL_NETWORK=testnet\n    ```\n\n    Then, make sure to run source it to load these variables:\n\n    ```sh\n    source .env\n    ```\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n## Global options\n\nAll of the global flags can also be passed as all-caps (prefixed with `RECALL_`), snake case\nenvironment variables that are set, or create and source them in a `env` file. For example,\n`--network` => `RECALL_NETWORK`, `--private-key` => `RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY`, etc.\n\n| Flag              | Description                                             | Env. variable          |\n| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |\n| `-n`, `--network` | Network presets for subnet and RPC (default: `testnet`) |

etc.","keywords":""},"content":"The core contracts manage subnet creation, token bridging, validator entrance, and all activities\nrelated to the core maintaining consensus over state (checkpointing, etc).\n\n## Gateway\n\nThe Gateway is a core component that handles cross-subnet communication and message passing between\nparent and child subnets in the IPC hierarchy. It manages the transfer of funds and messages between\nsubnets through checkpointing mechanisms. For example, when you deposit or withdraw RECALL, the\ngateway is responsible for ensuring both the parent and child subnet states are in sync.\n\n## Registry\n\nThe Registry maintains the record of all subnets in the IPC hierarchy. It helps track subnet\nrelationships and configurations and works alongside the Gateway to enable proper routing and\nvalidation of cross-subnet communications.\n\n## Supply source\n\nThe supply source for a subnet is the RECALL ERC20 token. Funds get deposited (bridged) from the\nparent chain (where the token was originally minted) into the subnet, and withdrawals are supported\nas well.\n\n## Validator gater\n\nThe Validator Gater controls actions like staking, unstaking, validator membership adjustments, and\nvalidator power assignments.\n\n## Validator rewarder\n\nThe Validator Rewarder contract handles the distribution of rewards to subnet validators.\n\n## Subnet actor\n\nThe Subnet Actor manages subnet operations including: validator set management, collateral handling,\ncheckpointing, cross-subnet message processing, and configuration management. It acts as the main\ncontrol point for subnet functionality and governance.\n\nWhen you see a subnet string ID values (e.g., `r314159/t410...`), the `t410...` part is the contract\naddress of the

testnet information below, such as contract addresses, chain information,\nand available RPCs. The RPCs and APIs listed below are public endpoints for Recall nodes ran by the\ncore team. The descriptions below break down the core contracts and their locations:\n\n* **Subnet**: The Recall chain where all transactions and storage operations occur. Most commonly,\n  this what developers will interact with.\n* **Parent**: The \"rootnet\" chain for managing Recall subnets, validators, checkpointing state, and\n  other core protocol operations. For example, the Recall testnet's parent chain is the Filecoin\n  Calibration testnet.\n\n<Callout type=\"warn\">\n  The Recall network is still under development, so these values are **heavily** subject to change.\n  The testnet will be upgraded every \\~2 weeks, and each upgrade will change certain contract addresses\n  and **delete all network data**.\n</Callout>\n\n## Testnet\n\n### Chain & subnet ID\n\n| Description | Value                                                   |\n| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Chain ID    | `2481632`                                               |\n| Subnet ID   | `/r314159/t410fxhurcl3in7vbb3l245noc3nace7il74t45js7sa` |\n\nThe subnet ID is comprised of the \"root\" chain ID and a path containing the subnet actor contract\naddress. For example, the string above denotes the rootnet L1 is chain ID `314159` (Filecoin\nCalibration), and only one child subnet exists, defined by the subnet actor contract address\n(displayed in its Wasm-style format).\n\n### RPCs and APIs\n\n| Description    | Value                                           |\n| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| Subnet EVM RPC | `https://evm.node-0.testnet.recall.network`     |\n| Object API     | `https://objects.node-0.testnet.recall.network` |\n| CometBFT RPC   | `https://api.node-0.testnet.recall.network`     |\n| Parent EVM RPC | `https://api.calibration.node.glif.io/rpc/v1`   |\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n  The Recall team runs three total nodes, so you can replace the `node-0` value with `node-1` or\n  `node-2` to connect to a different node.\n</Callout>\n\n### Contracts\n\n#### Core\n\n| Description           | Location | Address                                                                                                                                    |\n| --------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Gateway               | Subnet   | [`0x77aa40b105843728088c0132e43fc44348881da8`](https://explorer.testnet.recall.network/address/0x77aa40b105843728088c0132e43fc44348881da8) |\n| Registry              | Subnet   | [`0x74539671a1d2f1c8f200826baba665179f53a1b7`](https://explorer.testnet.recall.network/address/0x74539671a1d2f1c8f200826baba665179f53a1b7) |\n| Supply source (ERC20) | Parent   | [`0x2e6453107b4417eC2fB58ABDcc2968955Bd005Df`](https://calibration.filfox.info/en/address/0x2e6453107b4417eC2fB58ABDcc2968955Bd005Df)      |\n| Gateway               | Parent   | [`0x45da97E918183cA1f2891E277F600fC0B2dDD9dC`](https://calibration.filfox.info/en/address/0x45da97E918183cA1f2891E277F600fC0B2dDD9dC)      |\n| Registry              | Parent   | [`0xd7719695eE7042cDCFF4065ef93346bF33222d78`](https://calibration.filfox.info/en/address/0xd7719695eE7042cDCFF4065ef93346bF33222d78)      |\n| Validator gater       | Parent   | [`0x7180b1e71814a3cdc62a414ae02e3f6e1314b209`](https://calibration.filfox.info/en/address/0x7180b1e71814a3cdc62a414ae02e3f6e1314b209)      |\n| Validator rewarder    | Parent   | [`0xD67851A6888556111087E24519b6D70DA57dAa5F`](https://calibration.filfox.info/en/address/0xD67851A6888556111087E24519b6D70DA57dAa5F)      |\n| Subnet actor          | Parent   | [`0xb9e9112f686fea10ed7ae75ae16da0113e85ff93`](https://calibration.filfox.info/en/address/0xb9e9112f686fea10ed7ae75ae16da0113e85ff93)      |\n\nNote that the subnet contracts will always be the same for any new subnet deployed.

wrappers","description":"Interfaces for interacting with core Wasm contracts.","category":"Advanced Topics, including SDKs, CLIs, S3 adapters, etc.","keywords":""},"content":"The Solidity wrappers are libraries that facilitate making calls to the Wasm runtime. Recall's core\nprotocol is written in Rust and uses a Wasm runtime to execute the core logic. This provides a\nmassive amount of flexibility, but it requires EVM counterparts to interact with any of the core\ncontracts, like buckets or blobs. It's recommended you use clients like the [SDKs](/advanced/sdk) to\nuse these directly.\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n  For more detailed information and usage, check out the contract repo:\n  [here](https://github.com/recallnet/contracts)\n</Callout>\n\n## Blob manager\n\nThe Blob Manager contract facilitates calls to the `Blobs` actor, solely focusing on storage\ncomponents (there are credit-related aspects, mentioned below). The following methods are available:\n\n* `addBlob`: Store a blob directly on the network (note: this provides the onchain interface but\n  does not handle actually uploading the data).\n* `deleteBlob`: Delete a blob from the network for a given blob hash and the subscription ID.\n* `overwriteBlob`: Overwrite an existing blob from the network.\n* `getBlob`: Get information about a specific blob given its hash.\n* `getBlobStatus`: Get a blob's status (whether it's added, pending, resolved, or failed).\n* `getPendingBlobs`: Get the values of pending blobs across the network.\n* `getPendingBlobsCount`: Get the number of pending blobs across the network.\n* `getPendingBytesCount`: Get the total number of pending bytes across the network.\n* `getStorageStats`: Get storage stats.\n* `getStorageUsage`: Get storage usage for an address.\n* `getSubnetStats`: Get subnet stats.\n\n## Bucket manager\n\nThe Bucket Manager contract faciliates calls to the `Bucket` actor. Certain methods, like adding\nobjects, require you use it in tandem with the objects API to upload data.\n\n* `createBucket`: Create a bucket for the specified address, with optional metadata.\n* `listBuckets`: List all buckets for the specified address.\n* `addObject`: Add an object to a bucket (while also uploading the data to the objects API).\n* `deleteObject`: Remove an object from a bucket.\n* `getObject`: Get an object from a bucket (in tandem with the objects API).\n* `queryObjects`: Query the bucket with a prefix, delimiter, start key, and limit.\n\n## Credit manager\n\nThe Credit Manager contract facilitates calls to the `Blobs` actor, but only the credit-related\nfunctions. It allows you to do the following:\n\n* `getAccount`: Get credit account info for an address.\n* `getCreditStats`: Get credit stats across all accounts.\n* `getCreditApproval`: Get credit approval

& setup","description":"Use existing S3 tooling alongside the Recall S3 adapter.","category":"Advanced Topics, including SDKs, CLIs, S3 adapters, etc.","keywords":"object storage, recall, bucket, buckets, web3, s3"},"content":"The `recall_s3` binary is a simple adapter that allows you to use the Recall object storage system\nwith S3 APIs. Let's walk through how to set it up, and subsequent pages walk through how to use it\nwith ancillary tools like MinIO.\n\n### Setup\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step>\n    ### Install\n\n    First, clone the repo:\n\n    ```sh\n    git clone https://github.com/recallnet/recall-s3\n    ```\n\n    Then, `cd` into `recall-s3` and install the adapter binary:\n\n    ```sh\n    make install\n    ```\n\n    This should make `recall_s3` available in your path, which you can verify with\n    `recall_s3 --version`. Alternatively, if you don't want to install it, you can run it directly with\n    `cargo run` in the subsequent step.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step>\n    ### Run the adapter\n\n    Starting the Recall S3 adapter uses port `8014` by default. There are three required flags:\n\n    * `--private-key`: Hex encoded, Ethereum-style private key (ECDSA, secp256k1) for sending\n      transactions (environment variable: `PRIVATE_KEY`).\n    * `--network`: The network to connect to (environment variable: `NETWORK`).\n    * `--access-key`: An S3 access key (e.g,. `AKEXAMPLES3S`)\n    * `--secret-key`: An S3 secret key (e.g., `SKEXAMPLES3S`)\n\n    ```sh\n    recall_s3 --private-key [your_private_key] --access-key AKEXAMPLES3S --secret-key SKEXAMPLES3S\n    ```\n\n    The access key and secret aren't used for anything other than matching the MinIO client\n    configuration. If you want to do read-only queries, simply omit the private key.\n\n    If you didn't install the binary in the previous step, you can run it directly with\n    `cargo run --features binary -- ...` and the arguments above.\n\n    <Callout type=\"info\">\n      If you do not already have a private key, you can generate one with the Recall CLI. You also *must*\n      make sure your account exists on the subnet, which requires you have deposited funds into your\n      subnet account. Neglecting this step will lead to errors like\n      `failed to init sequence; actor ... cannot be found`.\n    </Callout>\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step>\n    ### Create an aliased bucket\n\n    Bucket usage slightly deviates from how you typically would in S3. This happens due to how the S3\n    adapter works alongside Recall by using aliases stored in metadata to help identify the bucket name\n    and its relationship with onchain buckets owned by the creator. To interact with any bucket, the\n    name you define is always prefixed by the creator's public key (i.e., EVM hex address), delimited by\n    a period.\n\n    The general format is `<0x_address>.<bucket_name>`. For example, if you create a bucket called\n    `my-store` with the private key `0x...`, the actual bucket name will be\n    `0x90f79bf6eb2c4f870365e785982e1f101e93b906.my-store`. Subsequent examples will describe this in\n    more detail with respect to the client that is used.\n\n    <Callout type=\"warn\">\n      The S3 API prohibits bucket names from being longer than 63 characters: here. Since a hex address is\n      42 characters, it leaves 20 characters for the *actual* bucket name (since bucket \"names\" are\n      defined as `<hex_address>.<name>` with a period in between).\n    </Callout>\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n## Next steps\n\nYou can now use Recall with any S3-compatible tooling! There are a few walkthroughs that show how to\nuse it with ancillary tools like MinIO and Python

the MinIO CLI","description":"Leverage the Recall S3 adapter with MinIO.","category":"Advanced Topics, including SDKs, CLIs, S3 adapters, etc.","keywords":"minio, object storage, bucket, buckets, web3, s3"},"content":"<Steps>\n  <Step>\n    ### Run the adapter\n\n    Start the adapter with the binary installed and flags described in the\n    [installation](/s3/installation) page.\n\n    ```sh\n    recall_s3 --private-key [your_private_key] --access-key AKEXAMPLES3S --secret-key SKEXAMPLES3S\n    ```\n\n    This will start the adapter on port `8014` by default. Also, recall the `--network` flag can,\n    optionally, be provided to point to a specific Recall chain environment, and logging can be enabled\n    by passing the `-v` flag.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step>\n    ### Run the S3 client\n\n    You can now use an S3-compatible client like MinIO to interact with Recall. First, make sure you\n    have the MinIO client installed, such as with Homebrew on Mac:\n\n    ```sh\n    brew install minio/stable/mc\n    ```\n\n    Then, add Recall as an alias to the MinIO configuration, and be sure to specify the API version as\n    `S3v4`. The URL shown below is the default port for the adapter, but you can change it by specifying\n    the `--address` flag.\n\n    ```sh\n    mc alias set recall http://localhost:8014 AKEXAMPLES3S SKEXAMPLES3S --api s3v4\n    ```\n\n    You can verify the alias was set properly with `mc alias list`:\n\n    ```sh\n    recall\n      URL       : http://localhost:8014\n      AccessKey : AKEXAMPLES3S\n      SecretKey : SKEXAMPLES3S\n      API       : s3v4\n      Path      : auto\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step>\n    ### Create a bucket\n\n    Now, you can directly use MinIO to write or read data! Start by creating a bucket:\n\n    ```sh\n    mc mb recall/my-store\n    ```\n\n    This will create the bucket called `my-store` under your `recall` alias. But, recall that the bucket\n    will *actually* get used under `<0x_address>.<bucket_name>`. The step below shows how to check the\n    actual bucket name.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step>\n    ### Check the bucket name\n\n    You can check the buckets under your alias with `mc ls recall`. This will list the bucket above with\n    the name we used:\n\n    ```sh\n    [2024-11-20 21:18:07 EST]     0B my-store/\n    ```\n\n    However, **this is not the bucket name**! The actual bucket name you'll use looks something like\n    this:\n\n    ```sh\n    0x90f79bf6eb2c4f870365e785982e1f101e93b906.my-store\n    ```\n\n    The `0x90f7...` is the public key of the creator (i.e., the private key you used to start the\n    adapter), and `my-store` is the bucket name we defined earlier. That is, whatever private key you're\n    using to run the adapter, simply use its public key as the hex value above.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step>\n    ### Write & read data\n\n    You can write to the address that identifies the bucket, where you'd replace `0x90f7...` with your\n    system-defined bucket name:\n\n    ```sh\n    mc put ./test.txt

Python & boto3","description":"Build Python applications with boto3 and the S3 adapter.","category":"Advanced Topics, including SDKs, CLIs, S3 adapters, etc.","keywords":"python, object storage, bucket, buckets, web3, s3"},"content":"<Steps>\n  <Step>\n    ### Run the adapter\n\n    Start the adapter with the binary installed and flags described in the\n    [installation](/s3/installation) page.\n\n    ```sh\n    recall_s3 --private-key [your_private_key] --access-key AKEXAMPLES3S --secret-key SKEXAMPLES3S\n    ```\n\n    This will start the adapter on port `8014` by default. Also, recall the `--network` flag can,\n    optionally, be provided to point to a specific Recall chain environment, and logging can be enabled\n    by passing the `-v` flag.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step>\n    ### Install boto3\n\n    Assuming you've already set up a Python environment, install `boto3`:\n\n    ```sh tab=\"pip\"\n    pip install boto3\n    ```\n\n    ```sh tab=\"uv\"\n    uv pip install boto3\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step>\n    ### Create helper functions\n\n    #### Create a connection\n\n    First, we'll import the necessary modules and define a helper function to connect to the adapter:\n\n    ```python\n    from boto3 import client as S3Client, session as S3Session\n    from botocore.config import Config\n    from botocore.exceptions import NoCredentialsError, PartialCredentialsError\n\n    # Establish a connection to the Recall S3 adapter\n    def connect_to_recall(host: str, access_key: str, secret_key: str) -> S3Client:\n        try:\n            # Create a session and S3 client\n            session = S3Session.Session()\n            recall = session.client(\n                \"s3\",\n                endpoint_url=host,\n                aws_access_key_id=access_key,\n                aws_secret_access_key=secret_key,\n                config=Config(\n                    retries={\"max_attempts\": 3},\n                    s3={\"addressing_style\": \"path\"},\n                ),\n            )\n            return recall\n        except (NoCredentialsError, PartialCredentialsError, Exception) as e:\n            print(f\"Failed to connect to Recall: {str(e)}\")\n            raise\n    ```\n\n    #### Create a bucket\n\n    Our bucket creation helper does one important thing: it prefixes the bucket name with the creator's\n    public key. This is important because the adapter has a slight workaround to work with Recall. Any\n    time you create a bucket with the S3 adapter, you'll initially define the name as something like\n    `my-bucket`. The actual onchain representation stores this as an alias with the bucket's metadata.\n    Then, when interacting with a bucket, you'll use the `<owner_address>.<bucket_name>` as the bucket\n    name.\n\n    ```python\n    # Create a bucket in Recall\n    def create_bucket(client: S3Client, bucket_name: str, owner_address: str) -> str | None:\n        try:\n            # Create a bucket (the name doesn't matter)\n            client.create_bucket(Bucket=bucket_name)\n            buckets = client.list_buckets()\n            # Find the bucket with matching name\n            matching_bucket = next(\n                (\n                    bucket[\"Name\"]\n                    for bucket in buckets[\"Buckets\"]\n                    if bucket[\"Name\"] == bucket_name\n                ),\n                None,\n            )\n            if matching_bucket:\n                # Alter the `Name` property to prefix the name: `<owner_address>.<bucket_name>`\n                prefixed_name = f\"{owner_address}.{bucket_name}\"\n                return prefixed_name\n            else:\n                print(f\"Could not find bucket with name: {bucket_name}\")\n                return None\n        except (NoCredentialsError, PartialCredentialsError, Exception) as e:\n            print(f\"An error occurred while creating a bucket: {e}\")\n            return None\n    ```\n\n    #### Interact with objects\n\n    The following functions interact with objects in the store, including writing, listing, and getting\n    objects.\n\n    ```python\n    # Write an object to the store under the given key with a value\n    def write_object(client: S3Client, bucket: str, key: str, value: str) -> None:\n        try:\n            client.put_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key, Body=value)\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"An error occurred while writing data: {e}\")\n\n\n    # List objects in the store, optionally, with a prefix\n    def list_objects(\n        client: S3Client, bucket: str, prefix: str | None = None\n    ) -> list | None:\n        options = {\"Bucket\": bucket}\n        if prefix is not None:\n            options[\"Prefix\"] = prefix\n        try:\n            response = client.list_objects(**options)\n            if \"Contents\" in response:\n                objects = response[\"Contents\"]\n                return objects\n            else:\n                return None\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"An error occurred while listing objects: {e}\")\n            return None\n\n\n    # Get an object from the store by key\n    def get_object(client: S3Client, bucket: str, key: str) -> str | None:\n        try:\n            response = client.get_object(\n                Bucket=bucket,\n                Key=key,\n            )\n            return response[\"Body\"].read()\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"An error occurred while getting object: {e}\")\n            return None\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step>\n    ### Connect, write, and read data\n\n    The example below demonstrates how to connect to the adapter, create a bucket, and interact with\n    objects. It establishes a connection, creates a bucket, writes a simple key/value pair, and then\n    reads it back.\n\n    The one callout is the `OWNER_ADDRESS` environment variable.\n\n    ```python\n    from os import getenv\n    from time import sleep\n\n    # Import the methods above if in a different file, or use accordingly\n\n    # Define your S3 adapter connection details\n    host = getenv(\"S3_HOST\") or \"http://localhost:8014\"\n    access_key = getenv(\"S3_ACCESS_KEY\") or \"S3EXAMPLEAK\"\n    secret_key = getenv(\"S3_SECRET_KEY\") or \"S3EXAMPLESK\"\n    # Note: below is the public key of a localnet account with private key:\n    # 7c852118294e51e653712a81e05800f419141751be58f605c371e15141b007a6\n    owner_address = (\n        getenv(\"OWNER_ADDRESS\") or \"0x90f79bf6eb2c4f870365e785982e1f101e93b906\"\n    )\n\n    # Connect to the Recall S3 adapter\n    recall = connect_to_recall(host, access_key, secret_key)\n    if recall is None:\n        raise RuntimeError(\"Failed to connect to Recall\")\n\n    # Create a bucket\n    bucket = create_bucket(recall, \"my-bucket\", owner_address)\n    if bucket is None:\n        raise RuntimeError(\"Failed to create bucket\")\n    print(f\"Bucket created successfully: {bucket}\")\n\n    # Write an object under the `hello/world` key\n    key_prefix = \"hello\"\n    key = f\"{key_prefix}/world\"\n    write_object(recall, bucket, key, b\"hello\")\n    print(f\"Uploaded file to Recall at key: {key}\")\n\n    print(\"Waiting for transaction to settle...\")\n    sleep(3)\n\n    # List objects\n    objects = list_objects(recall, bucket, f\"{key_prefix}/\")\n    if not objects:\n        print(\"No objects found after upload\")\n        return\n\n    # Get an object from the list\n    object_key =

to have the most control over their development environment, Recall offers\nSDKs that expose all of the low-level components needed to build agents and applications.\n\n## Language support\n\nRecall currently offers SDKs written in two languages, and we'll continue to add additional language\nsupport over time:\n\n<Cards>\n  <Card title=\"TypeScript\" href=\"/advanced/sdk/javascript\" description=\"Build agents with the Recall API in JS/TS\" />\n\n  <Card title=\"Rust\" href=\"/advanced/sdk/rust\" description=\"Build agents with the Recall API in Rust\" />\n</Cards>\n\nThe Rust SDK provides the greatest API surface area since it has access to the same libraries in\nwhich the core Recall protocol is written in.

SDK","description":"Learn how to use the JavaScript SDK to interact with Recall.","category":"Advanced Topics, including SDKs, CLIs, S3 adapters, etc.","keywords":"javascript sdk, js sdk, typescript sdk, ts sdk"},"content":"## Overview\n\nThe `@recall/sdk` package is a JS/TS SDK for the Recall Network. It is built on top of\n[viem](https://viem.sh/) and designed to interact with Recall subnets for various operations,\nincluding:\n\n* **Buckets**: Create buckets, add objects, get objects, delete objects, etc.\n* **Credit**: Buy credit, approve credit usage, get credit balance, etc.\n* **Accounts**: Get token balance, deposit funds, withdraw funds, etc.\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n  This section is under construction. The current JavaScript SDK is a work in progress and can be\n  found [here](https://github.com/recallnet/js-recall). However, it is heavily subject to changes that\n  will likely not be backwards compatible.\n</Callout>\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step>\n    ## Installation\n\n    First, install the package:\n\n    ```package-install\n    pnpm add @recall/sdk\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step>\n    ## Create a wallet client\n\n    Create a wallet client from a private key:\n\n    ```ts\n    import { createWalletClient } from \"viem\";\n    import { privateKeyToAccount } from \"viem/accounts\";\n\n    import { RecallClient, testnet } from \"@recall/sdk\";\n\n    // Create a wallet client from a private key\n    const privateKey = \"0x7c852118294e51e653712a81e05800f419141751be58f605c371e15141b007a6\";\n    const walletClient = createWalletClient({\n      account: privateKeyToAccount(privateKey),\n      chain: testnet,\n      transport: http(),\n    });\n\n    // Create a client from the wallet client\n    const recall = new RecallClient({ walletClient });\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step>\n    ### Purchase credit\n\n    ```ts\n    // Set up credit manager\n    const creditManager = client.creditManager();\n\n    // Buy 1 credit (swaps for RECALL tokens)\n    const { meta: creditMeta } = await creditManager.buy(parseEther(\"1\"));\n    console.log(\"Credit purchased at:\", creditMeta?.tx?.transactionHash); // 0x...\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step>\n    ## Create a bucket\n\n    ```ts\n    const bucketManager = client.bucketManager();\n    const {\n      result: { bucket },\n    } = await bucketManager.create();\n    console.log(\"Bucket created:\", bucket); // 0xff00...9d\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step>\n    ## Add an object to a bucket\n\n    ```typescript\n    const key = \"hello/world\";\n    const content = new TextEncoder().encode(\"hello world\");\n    const file = new File([content], \"file.txt\", {\n      type: \"text/plain\",\n    });\n    // Or from a file\n    // const file = fs.readFileSync(\"path/to/file.txt\");\n\n    const { meta: addMeta } = await bucketManager.add(bucket, key, file);\n    console.log(\"Object added at:\", addMeta?.tx?.transactionHash); // 0x...\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step>\n    ## Query objects\n\n    ```typescript\n    const prefix = \"hello/\";\n    const {\n      result: { objects },\n    } = await bucketManager.query(bucket, { prefix });\n    console.log(\"Objects:\", objects);\n    // [\n    //   {\n    //     \"key\": \"hello/world\",\n    //     \"value\": {\n    //       \"hash\": \"3rne5w4cicybqesaklbtajygs34wo4nghncskcs4c7jqaducgnkq\",\n    //       \"size\": 6,\n    //       \"metadata\": {\n    //         \"content-type\": \"application/octet-stream\"\n    //       }\n    //     }\n    //   }\n    // ]\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step>\n    ## Get an object\n\n

simple agent that can answer questions.","category":"Getting Started with Recall, including quickstarts, faucet and portal guides, and basic concepts","keywords":""},"content":"Get started with CoT logs and observability with the Recall agent starter kit. If you have an\nexisting agent, all you need to do is drop in a couple of small changes to your character's system\nprompt and then expose the `plugin-recall-storage` to your agent.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step>\n    ## Installation\n\n    Clone the [Recall agent starter kit](https://github.com/recallnet/recall-agent-starter):\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/recallnet/recall-agent-starter.git\n    ```\n\n    Change into the project directory:\n\n    ```bash\n    cd recall-agent-starter\n    ```\n\n    Install the dependencies:\n\n    ```package-install\n    npm install\n    ```\n\n    Build the project:\n\n    ```package-install\n    npm run build\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step>\n    ## Set up your agent's account\n\n    In order to interact with Recall, you need an account (private key) that owns both credits and\n    tokens. If needed, you can create one by running the following command with the\n    [Recall CLI](/advanced/cli/account#create-an-account), which prints both the private key and the\n    public key (address):\n\n    ```bash\n    recall account create\n    ```\n\n    Then, head to the [Recall Faucet](/intro/faucet) request some tokens with your address.\n\n    Lastly, you **must** purchase credits to store logs in your agents memory bucket—see the Portal\n    guide [here](/intro/portal) for more details. Alternatively, you can use the CLI to\n    [purchase credits](http://localhost:3001/advanced/cli/account#buy-credit) for your agent to use, or\n    purchase credit for your personal account and\n    [delegate access](http://localhost:3001/advanced/cli/account#approve-credit) to your agent's wallet.\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step>\n    ## Set up your environment\n\n    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following.\n\n    ```bash\n    RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY=\"your-private-key\"\n    RECALL_BUCKET_ALIAS=\"logs\"\n    COT_LOG_PREFIX=\"cot/\"\n    OPENAI_API_KEY=\"your-api-key\"\n    ```\n\n    An example character file is provided in `characters/eliza.character.json`, and it defaults to using\n    OpenAI models (but you can choose your own provider). You can customize this to your liking, but the\n    essential modifications include a CoT and reasoning logging:\n\n    * `system`: Modify the system prompt to coerce the model to reason through its response.\n    * `messageExamples`: Add examples of CoT and reasoning logging to help the model understand how to\n      respond.\n\n    ```json title=\"characters/eliza.character.json\"\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Recall Agent\",\n      \"modelProvider\": \"openai\", // Optionally, change the model provider.\n      // ...\n      \"system\": \"# Instructions: Think step-by-step before responding.\\n\\nPlease follow these steps in your chain-of-thought: ...\",\n      // ...\n      \"messageExamples\": [\n        [\n          {\n            \"user\": \"{{user1}}\",\n            \"content\": {\n              \"text\": \"hey Recall Agent, you can add an object to the bucket named 'foo'?\"\n            }\n          },\n          {\n            \"user\": \"Recall Agent\",\n            \"content\": {\n              \"text\": \"<chain-of-thought>...</chain-of-thought>\\nFinal Answer:\\n...\"\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step>\n    ## Run the agent\n\n    Being by running the `start` script, passing in the character file:\n\n    ```package-install\n    npm run start -- --character characters/eliza.character.json\n    ```\n\n    This will start up a chat agent that you can interact with. The agent will store CoT logs locally\n    and batch them into `jsonl` files at predefined intervals and size thresholds. As the model takes\n    actions, you'll be able to see the actions and batching logs:\n\n    ```\n    [2025-02-07 17:13:31] INFO: Starting periodic log sync...\n    [2025-02-07 17:13:31] INFO: Looking for bucket with alias: logs\n    [2025-02-07 17:13:31] INFO: Bucket with alias \"logs\" not found, creating a new one.\n    c[2025-02-07 17:13:36] INFO: Successfully created new bucket \"logs\" at 0xff0000000000000000000000000000000000008f\n    [2025-02-07 17:13:36] INFO: Found 1 unsynced logs.\n    [2025-02-07 17:13:36] INFO: Processing log entry of size: 861 bytes\n    [2025-02-07 17:13:36] INFO: Current batch size is 861 bytes, within the limit of 4 KB. Not syncing yet.\n    ```\n\n    Let's send a simple message to the agent:\n\n    ```\n    You: Create a bucket named 'recall-agent'\n    Agent: ✅ Successfully created or retrieved bucket **\"recall-agent\"** at address: **0xff00000000000000000000000000000000000094**\n    ```\n\n    The step above will log information about what the agent is doing, but this is *only* available\n    locally. Fore example, it's printed to the console, and only certain pieces might be included in the\n    default databases that come with the Eliza stack.\n\n    ```\n    [2025-02-07 17:14:18] INFO: Executing handler for action: CREATE_BUCKET\n    [2025-02-07 17:14:18] INFO: CREATE_BUCKET Handler triggered: Create a bucket named 'recall-agent'\n    [2025-02-07 17:14:18] INFO: Creating bucket with alias: recall-agent\n    [2025-02-07 17:14:18] INFO: Looking for bucket with alias: recall-agent\n    [2025-02-07 17:14:18] INFO: Bucket with alias \"recall-agent\" not found, creating a new one.\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step>\n    ## Inspect the logs and CoT\n\n    Once the batch size is exceeded, the logs will be synced to Recall:\n\n    ```\n    [2025-02-07 17:14:21] INFO: Batch size currently 4423 bytes, exceeding limit of 4 KB.

From the previous interactions, it is evident that the user has already been interacting with the Recall service, as seen from the queries about Recall.\\n3. The task is straightforward: to create a new bucket with the specified name 'recall-agent' on the Recall service.\\n4. The most appropriate action from the available actions is CREATE_BUCKET, as it directly aligns with the user's request to create a new bucket on the Recall service.\\n5. There is no indication that this bucket already exists, so the action should proceed to create it.\"\n    }\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step>\n    ## Visualize the logs\n\n    Head over to the [Recall Portal](https://portal.recall.network) and search for the bucket.

up the Recall SDK in your Rust environment.","category":"Advanced Topics, including SDKs, CLIs, S3 adapters, etc.","keywords":"rust sdk, rust, sdk, recall sdk, rs sdk"},"content":"The Recall SDK is a Rust library that provides a simple interface for interacting with Recall\nbuckets. It is designed to be easy to use and flexible, allowing you to build applications that\ninteract with buckets in a variety of ways.\n\nThere are two primary crates that are used in tandem with the Recall SDK crate. All three *may* be\nrequired, depending on the use case, so let's break down what each crate does:\n\n* `recall_provider`: Provides the means to interact with the bucket storage system via a chain and\n  object provider.\n* `recall_signer`: A transaction signer to help manage sending transactions to the subnet.\n* `recall_sdk`: The Recall SDK itself, which provides a simple interface for interacting with Recall\n  and uses the other two crates to do so.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo use the Recall SDK in your Rust project, add the following dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`\nfile:\n\n```toml\nrecall_provider = { git = \"https://github.com/recallnet/rust-recall.git\" }\nrecall_sdk = { git = \"https://github.com/recallnet/rust-recall.git\" }\nrecall_signer = { git = \"https://github.com/recallnet/rust-recall.git\" }\n```\n\nBe sure to replace the revision hash with the latest version in the repo for the most up-to-date\ncode!\n\n## Additional dependencies\n\nWe'll also use the following, which are common for handling asynchronous network operations:\n\n* `tokio`: Async file operations.\n* `async-tempfile`: Create async temporary files when

the basics for connecting to Recall and using buckets.","category":"Advanced Topics, including SDKs, CLIs, S3 adapters, etc.","keywords":""},"content":"The most basic usage will likely involve connecting to the network, creating an bucket, and then\nadding or getting objects. This page walks through each step and provides examples to help you get\nstarted.\n\n## Signer & provider setup\n\nTo create an bucket, you'll need to use the `JsonRpcProvider` from the `recall_provider` crate plus\nvarious `recall_sdk` types.\n\nHere's a simple example. The `signer.init_sequence()` call is optional, but without it, you'll run\ninto issues with out of sync sequences (nonces). **It's best to call `init_sequence` unless you're\nfiring many transactions at once.**\n\n```rust\nuse std::collections::HashMap;\n\nuse recall_provider::json_rpc::JsonRpcProvider;\nuse recall_sdk::{\n    machine::{bucket::Bucket, Machine},\n    network::Network,\n};\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() {\n    let network = Network::Testnet.init();\n    let provider =\n        JsonRpcProvider::new_http(network.rpc_url()?, None, Some(network.object_api_url()?))?;\n    let file = async_tempfile::TempFile::new().await?;\n\n    signer.init_sequence(&provider).await?;\n}\n```\n\n## Creating a bucket\n\nTo create a bucket, you'll need to use the `Bucket::new` method, which takes a few arguments:\n\n* The RPC provider.\n* The signer.\n* An optional `owner` address, which defaults to the signer's address.\n* A `HashMap` of metadata to assign to the bucket (use `Default::default()` to create an empty map).\n* Lastly, optional gas parameters (these can be imported from\n  `recall_provider::message::GasParams`).\n\n```rust\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() {\n    // Existing code...\n\n    let (bucket, tx) = Bucket::new(\n        &provider,\n        &mut signer,\n        None,\n        HashMap::new(),\n        Default::default(),\n    ).await?;\n}\n```\n\nNote the second value returned is the onchain transaction that created the bucket.\n\n## Adding an object\n\nWe can extend the example above to add an object to the bucket. The `add` method is used to add an\nobject to the bucket given a provider, signer, the object's desired key (e.g., `my/key`), and\noptions that control its behavior. For example, you can add other metadata to an object or specify\nhow to handle overwriting an existing object.\n\n```rust\nuse std::collections::HashMap;\n\nuse recall_sdk::{\n    machine::{\n        bucket::{AddOptions, Bucket}, // [!code highlight]\n        Machine,\n    },\n    network::Network,\n};\nuse tokio::io::{AsyncSeekExt, AsyncWriteExt}; // [!code highlight]\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() {\n    // Existing code...\n\n    let file = async_tempfile::TempFile::new().await?;\n    file.write_all(\"hello world\".as_bytes()).await?;\n    file.flush().await?;\n    file.rewind().await?;\n\n    let key = \"my/key\";\n    let mut metadata = HashMap::new();\n    metadata.insert(\"foo\".to_string(), \"bar\".to_string());\n    let options = AddOptions {\n        overwrite: true,\n        metadata,\n        ..Default::default()\n    };\n    let tx = bucket\n        .add_from_path(&provider, &mut signer, key, file.file_path(), options)\n        .await?;\n}\n```\n\n## Querying objects\n\nTo list an object, you can use the `query` method. This method comes with available query options to\nrefine your results:\n\n* `prefix`: The prefix of the keys you want to list.\n* `delimiter`: The delimiter to use when listing keys.\n* `start_key`: The key to start listing keys from.\n* `limit`: The maximum number of keys to list.\n* `height`: The block height to list objects for (defaults to the latest committed height).\n\n```rust\nuse recall_sdk::{\n    machine::{\n        objectstore::{AddOptions, ObjectStore, QueryOptions}, // [!code highlight]\n        Machine,\n    },\n    network::Network,\n};\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() {\n    // Existing code...\n\n    let options = QueryOptions {\n        prefix: \"my/\".to_string(),\n        delimiter: \"/\".to_string(),\n        start_key: None,\n        limit: 1,\n        height: Default::default(),\n    };\n    let list = bucket.query(&provider, options).await?;\n}\n```\n\nThis will give you a list of all objects and any other common prefixes down the tree.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"objects\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"hello/world\",\n      \"value\": {\n        \"hash\": \"rzghyg4z3p6vbz5jkgc75lk64fci7kieul65o6hk6xznx7lctkmq\",\n        \"size\": 6,\n        \"metadata\": {\n          \"new\": \"foo\",\n          \"content-type\": \"application/octet-stream\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"common_prefixes\": [],\n  \"next_key\": null\n}\n```\n\n## Getting an object\n\nYou can use the `get` method to retrieve data and download the actual contents. A few options are\navailable to refine your results:\n\n* `bytes`: Range request bytes as a dash-separated string (e.g., `\"0-99\"` gets the first 100 bytes).\n* `height`: The height of the bucket to list keys from (defaults to the latest committed height).\n* `show_progress`: Visually show the download progress (useful with CLI tools).\n\n```rust\nuse recall_sdk::{\n    machine::{\n        objectstore::{AddOptions, GetOptions, ObjectStore, QueryOptions}, // [!code highlight]\n        Machine,\n    },\n    network::Network,\n};\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() {\n    // Existing code...\n\n    let options = GetOptions {\n        range: Some(\"0-99\".to_string()), // Get the first 100 bytes\n        ..Default::default()\n    };\n\n    let file = async_tempfile::TempFile::new().await?;\n    {\n        let open_file = file.open_rw().await?;\n        bucket.get(&provider, &key, open_file, options).await?;\n    }\n    // Read the first 10 bytes of your downloaded 100 bytes\n    let mut read_file = tokio::fs::File::open(&file.file_path()).await?;\n    let mut contents = vec![0; 10];\n    read_file.write_all(&mut contents).await?;\n}\n```\n\n## Deleting an object\n\nLastly, since buckets are a fully mutable store, you can delete an object using the `delete` method.\nIt takes similar parameters as adding an object. The default options are generally used, which let\nyou specify the broadcast mode and gas parameters.\n\n```rust\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() {\n    // Existing code...\n\n    let tx = bucket\n        .delete(&provider, &mut signer, &key, Default::default())\n        .await?;\n}\n```\n\nThe response will be similar to the `add` example above.\n\n## Network interactions\n\nYou can review the `recall_sdk::network` module for more information or check out the network\nconfiguration docs. Utility methods exist on the `recall_sdk::network::Network` struct to fetch\nnetwork values dynamically, so there's not necessarily a need to hardcode them yourself
