# Recall SDKs

Recall SDKs provide the most complete access to the Recall platform's capabilities. They expose low-level components for building applications, infrastructure, and custom tooling that interacts with the Recall network.

<Callout type="info">
  If you're building an AI agent, consider using the [Agent Toolkit](/agent-toolkit) first, as it provides a simplified API designed specifically for agent development. The SDK is best suited for infrastructure developers who need complete control over Recall operations.
</Callout>

## Language Support

Recall currently offers SDKs in two languages:

<Cards>
  <Card title="TypeScript" href="/tools/sdk/javascript" description="Build applications with the Recall API in JS/TS">
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rust" href="/tools/sdk/rust" description="Build high-performance applications with the Recall API in Rust">
  </Card>
</Cards>

The Rust SDK provides the greatest API surface area since it has access to the same libraries in which the core Recall protocol is written. The TypeScript SDK is a lighter weight SDK that is easier to use in the browser and Node.js environments.

## When to Use the SDK

The SDK is the right choice when:

- You need direct access to low-level Recall functionality
- You're building custom infrastructure or developer tools
- You require advanced features not exposed in higher-level libraries
- You're integrating Recall into existing applications
- You need maximum performance and control
- You're implementing custom storage patterns

## SDK vs. Agent Toolkit

| SDK | Agent Toolkit |
|-----|---------------|
| Complete API access | Focused on agent-specific operations |
| More complex setup | Simple framework-specific adapters |
| Advanced configuration options | Streamlined configuration |
| Raw data structures | Agent-friendly abstractions |
| Manual integration with AI frameworks | Built-in framework adapters |

## Core SDK Features

The SDKs provide access to all Recall functionality:

- **Accounts**: Manage accounts, keys, and credentials
- **Storage**: Full access to buckets, objects, and metadata
- **Cryptography**: Sign and verify operations
- **Networking**: Connect to different Recall networks
- **Serialization**: Work with Recall's data formats
- **Configuration**: Custom configuration for all operations

## Usage Examples

### TypeScript SDK Basic Usage

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm install @recallnet/sdk
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn add @recallnet/sdk
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm add @recallnet/sdk
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

```typescript
import { RecallClientBuilder } from "@recallnet/sdk";

// Create a client with a private key and network
const client = await RecallClientBuilder.create()
  .withPrivateKey(process.env.RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY)
  .withNetwork("testnet")
  .build();

// List all buckets
const buckets = await client.listBuckets();
console.log("Your buckets:", buckets);

// Create a new bucket
const bucket = await client.createBucket("my-custom-bucket");

// Add an object to the bucket
const objectId = await client.addObject(
  "my-custom-bucket",
  {
    type: "text/plain",
    data: new TextEncoder().encode("Hello, Recall!")
  }
);

// Get the object
const object = await client.getObject("my-custom-bucket", objectId);
console.log("Retrieved object:",
  new TextDecoder().decode(object.data)
);
```

### Advanced Storage Patterns

```typescript
// Advanced bucket management with metadata
const bucket = await client.createBucket("analytics-data", {
  metadata: {
    purpose: "Data analytics storage",
    team: "research",
    retention: "90-days"
  }
});

// Structured data storage with schema validation
const jsonData = {
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  metrics: {
    accuracy: 0.92,
    latency: 45,
    throughput: 125
  },
  source: "agent-evaluation"
};

// Store structured data with content type
const objectId = await client.addObject(
  "analytics-data",
  {
    type: "application/json",
    data: new TextEncoder().encode(JSON.stringify(jsonData))
  }
);

// Query objects with complex filters
const results = await client.queryObjects("analytics-data", {
  filter: {
    dateRange: {
      field: "created",
      startDate: new Date(Date.now() - 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000),
      endDate: new Date()
    },
    contentTypePrefix: "application/json"
  },
  limit: 100
});
```
