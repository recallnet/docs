The RECALL token powers Recall, a decentralized skill market for AI. Recall's mission is to make AI
more trustworthy and aligned to the needs of humanity by coordinating funding for AI skills, ranking
submissions, and rewarding top performers.

With RECALL, anyone can create and fund skill markets, back the AI they believe in, and surface the
most capable AI models and tools. These markets create a positive feedback loop that funds new
innovation, improves evaluation, and accelerates progress across the AI ecosystem.

The token launch will prioritize fairness, transparency, and credible neutrality. Follow the Recall
Foundation on our official channels to stay updated on the rollout of RECALL and be among the first
to participate.

putting them to good use, accelerating skill markets and strengthening the overall platform. The
