## Overview

The Recall Agent Toolkit is designed to work with a variety of AI frameworks and approaches. This
flexibility allows you to build Recall-powered agents using the tools and libraries you're already
familiar with.

<Callout type="warning" title="Agent setup & storage requirements">

All Recall operations require tokens and credits. Before getting started, you'll need to:

1. Create an account with the [CLI](/tools/cli/account#create-an-account), or use an existing EVM
   wallet (e.g., export from MetaMask).
2. Get tokens from the [Recall Faucet](https://faucet.recall.network) for your wallet address.
3. Purchase credit for your account with the [Recall Portal](https://portal.recall.network) or the
   [CLI](/tools/cli/account#buy-credit).

## How MCP enables agent autonomy

Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for AI models to discover and invoke tools
autonomously. The key principles are:

1. **Tool registration**: Tools are made available to the model (e.g., Recall storage operations)
2. **Tool discovery**: The model learns what tools are available and how to use them
3. **Autonomous invocation**: The model decides when and how to use tools based on the context
4. **Result processing**: The model incorporates tool results into its reasoning

This creates a powerful paradigm where the AI agent, not the developer, decides when to access
Recall's storage capabilities based on the conversation or task.

## Choosing a framework

Each framework has its own strengths and use cases. Here's a quick comparison to help you decide:

| Framework                          | Best For                               | Key Features                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [MCP](/mcp)                        | Claude, Cursor, direct LLM integration | Universal protocol, works with multiple clients                                       |
| [Mastra](/frameworks/mastra)       | Agent development with memory          | Open-source TypeScript agent framework with memory, function execution and evaluation |
| [LangChain](/frameworks/langchain) | Complex agent workflows, tool chaining | Extensive ecosystem, structured workflows                                             |
| [OpenAI](/frameworks/openai)       | GPT integration, assistant API         | Simplest integration with OpenAI models                                               |
| [AI SDK](/frameworks/ai-sdk)       | Web applications, Next.js              | Frontend integration, streaming responses                                             |
| [Eliza](/frameworks/eliza)         | Simple rule-based agents               | Lightweight, no LLM dependencies                                                      |

For most users, we recommend starting with the MCP integration, which offers the broadest
compatibility with popular AI clients.

## Common integration pattern

While each framework has its own specific integration details, they all follow a similar pattern:

1. **Install the Agent Toolkit**
2. **Configure permissions and context**
3. **Initialize the framework-specific adapter**
4. **Provide Recall tools to the AI agent**
5. **The agent autonomously decides when to use Recall capabilities**

Here's a simplified example using the MCP adapter (the code won't work but demonstrates the
pattern):

1. Import the necessary packages:

   ```typescript
   import { RecallAgentToolkit } from "@recallnet/agent-toolkit/mcp";
   import { Agent } from "@your-framework/agent";
   // Note: This is a placeholder for the actual agent framework you're using
   import { MCPConfiguration } from "@your-framework/mcp";
   ```

2. Configure permissions and context:

   ```typescript
   const recallToolkit = new RecallAgentToolkit({
     privateKey: process.env.RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY,
     configuration: {
       actions: {
         account: { read: true, write: true },
         bucket: { read: true, write: true },
       },
       context: {
         network: "testnet",
       },
     },
   });
   ```

3. Initialize the adapter:

   ```typescript
   // Note: This is a placeholder for the actual agent framework you're using
   const mcp = new MCPConfiguration({
     servers: {
       recall: {
         name: "recall-storage",
         server: recallToolkit,
       },
     },
   });
   ```

4. Create agent with tools:

   ```typescript
   const agent = new Agent({
     model: "gpt-4o",
     tools: mcp.getTools(), // Or however you're initializing tools in your framework
     instructions: "You have access to Recall storage capabilities.",
   });
   ```

5. Agent autonomously decides when to use tools:

   ```typescript
   const result = await agent.run("Store today's meeting notes for me");
   ```

## Custom integrations

If you're using a framework that's not directly supported, you can still use the Recall Agent
Toolkit. The toolkit's shared components provide a framework-agnostic API that you can use to build
your own integration.
