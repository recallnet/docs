title: Running the devnet
description: Leverage a Dockerized multi-node setup for development.
---

This page walks through how to spin up a local Recall network on your machine (`devnet`) and
presumes you've done the steps described in the preceding [setup page](/tools/local). Most
developers will never need to run the devnet. It's only useful if you're making changes to the core
`ipc` protocol codebase and want to test your changes.

## Overview

The devnet requires you run multiple services manually and have the binaries installed on your host
machine. At a minimum, you'll need to install CometBFT, Fendermint, and Iroh. Optionally, you can
also run the EVM RPC service, in case you want to interact with the devnet via EVM RPCs (e.g.,
deploying Solidity contracts). It's significantly faster to spin up as compared to the `localnet`
setup.

## Build dependencies

The following assumes you're working in the root of the `ipc` repo, and **not** in this `scripts`
directory.

#### CometBFT

Navigate outside this repo and install CometBFT (note: you **must** install `v0.37.1` since the
latest version is not compatible with the rest of the codebase):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft.git
cd cometbft
git checkout v0.37.1
make install
```

#### Fendermint & IPC CLI

Navigate back into `ipc`. The default `make` task will build the contracts, libraries, and CLIs
needed to run a `devnet`.

```bash
make
```

## Setup

First, configure the `devnet` with the following, which creates some keys and alters the
configuration located in `~/.fendermint`:

```bash
make config-devnet
```

The keys used here are a bit different from how the `localnet` setup works. The `localnet` relies on
the `ipc-cli` for much of its logic, whereas the `devnet` relies primarily on the `fendermint` CLI.

### Accounts

The keys you'll use can be found in the `test-network/keys` directory within this `scripts` folder.
Only the `alice` key is deterministically coded into the Fendermint startup process. You can export
any of the keys to a hex encoded EVM format.

From the root of this repo, run the following command, replacing `alice.sk` with the corresponding
filename and `alice_eth` with a desired name (for files that get created later):

```bash
fendermint key into-eth --secret-key ./scripts/test-network/keys/alice.sk --name alice_eth
```

Since the `alice.sk` will always be the same, the following is consistent across machines and can be
used for `devnet` interactions (e.g., creating buckets, timehubs, writing data, etc.):

- EVM address: `0xc05fe6b63ffa4b3c518e6ff1e597358ee839db01`
- Hex private key: `1c323d494d1d069fe4c891350a1ec691c4216c17418a0cb3c7533b143bd2b812`

## Startup & shutdown

Finally, start all the services in separate terminal windows in the following order. The associated
endpoints are shown below.

<Steps>

<Step>

### Iroh

Start the blob store, which runs at `http://127.0.0.1:4919`.

```bash
make run-devnet-iroh
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Objects API

Start the objects API, which runs at `http://127.0.0.8001`.

```bash
make run-devnet-objects
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Fendermint

Start the Fendermint service, which runs at `http://127.0.0.1:26658`.

```bash
make run-devnet-fendermint
```

</Step>

<Step>

### CometBFT

Start the CometBFT service, which runs at `http://127.0.0.1:26657`.

```bash
make run-devnet-cometbft
```

</Step>

<Step>

### EVM RPC

Start the EVM RPC service, which runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8545`.

```bash
make run-devnet-evm
```

</Step>

</Steps>

Once these are running, you should be able to interact with the `devnet` and _most_ of the expected
functionality. One thing to be aware of: there's no parent (rootnet), so certain parts of the
protocol (like deploying parent contracts, ERC20s, or Solidity wrappers) don't happen automatically.

Lastly, keep in mind that if you ever make changes to the core `ipc` codebase and want the devnet to
use these changes, you'll need to shut these services down (i.e., exit the processes), run `make`,
and then `make config-devnet` again.

## Usage

If you're using the `recall` CLI, you must set the `RECALL_NETWORK` environment variable to `devnet`
in order to use it. Note that `fendermint` `ipc-cli` the `NETWORK` flag but with different target
functionality, so be sure the `RECALL_` prefix is attached.

```bash
export RECALL_NETWORK=devnet
export RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY=1c323d494d1d069fe4c891350a1ec691c4216c17418a0cb3c7533b143bd2b812
```

Similarly, you'll use the `devnet` in the Rust SDK where necessaryâ€”e.g.,
`recall_sdk::network::Network::Devnet.init()`, or the JS SDK lets you import the `devnet` chain.
