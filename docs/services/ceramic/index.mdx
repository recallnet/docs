Ceramic is a decentralized data network provides web3 developers with a collection of features that
make it possible to build scalable web3 applications with composable data that can be reused and
shared across applications. Data written to Ceramic has the following unique properties:

- **Verifiability**: All data written to Ceramic is signed by its author, meaning data on Ceramic is
  self-certifying and trustworthy.
- **Composability**: Data in Ceramic is organized by [models](/ceramic/concepts). When applications
  use the same data models, the data they create can be viewed as one, universal dataset. Ceramic
  makes it easy to compose data from distinct applications and users into a single, hackable
  dataset.
- **Scalable**: Data in Ceramic is sharded by author by default. In exchange for giving up
  transactionality, Ceramic elegantly scales to massive datasets.
- **Secure**: Ceramic gains a sense of time by anchoring its data to a blockchain, which allows
  Ceramic nodes to assert when data was created. Ceramic uses this sense of time to implement
  expiring user sessions, meaning one compromised session keypair doesn't permanently taint a user's
  identity.
- **Private**: Ceramic makes it possible for users to determine what data is shared with which
  entities at what time.
