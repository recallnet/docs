description: Open-source relational database built on top of Ceramic.
---

OrbisDB is a fully open-source relational database built on top of Ceramic, a decentralized event
store. It inherits data ownership, composability and decentralized properties of Ceramic, while
providing a highly scalable way of querying data via SQL, GraphQL and a built-in Dashboard.

## Features

- Easy setup
- Scalability
- Decentralized
- Composable
- Contextualized
- Data ownership
- Customizable
- PostgreSQL
- GraphQL

## Motivation

OrbisDB is a successor of Orbis, an open social protocol. The experience of building a user and
developer friendly open social protocol gave us insights into existing solutions and their
limitations.

Most web3 database solutions today come with trade-offs such as high gas costs, scalability issues
or a completely new architecture and developer experience.

OrbisDB, on other hand, builds on top of existing
[solutions and protocols](/databases/orbisdb/managing-data). This allows us to focus on the core
product, without reinventing existing foundations. It also benefits from the existing vast
ecosystems.

Since nobody can predict all the use cases, OrbisDB comes with plugins, allowing anyone to build and
extend core functionality, expose new API routes or customize the way data is being validated and
stored.
