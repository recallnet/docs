## Hardware requirements

To run a Recall node, we **_strongly_** recommend the following hardware. However, these values are
subject to change based on network optimizations, the number of nodes, and learnings as the network
progresses toward mainnet.

| Hardware          | Testnet | Mainnet (not live) |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| CPU cores         | 8       | 8                  |
| Memory            | 32 (GB) | 32 (GB)            |
| Disk space (HDD)  | 32 (TB) | 480 (TB)           |
| Network bandwidth | 1 GB/s  | 1 GB/s             |
| Public IP Address | 1       | 1                  |

## Validators

Validators maintain the Recall Blockchain through a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol, where they are
selected to produce blocks based on their staked assets. This selection is proportional to their
stake, ensuring that those with more significant investment in the network have a larger role in its
maintenance. Validators are incentivized to act honestly, as any malicious activity can lead to the
loss of their staked assets through slashing (_not yet live_).

Validators are also responsible for securely storing and maintaining data. This is crucial for the
network's primary function as a data storage system. The integrity and availability of data are
ensured through mechanisms that require validators to verifiably store and retrieve data. Validators
are rewarded for this service, with fees paid by users for storing and retrieving data. As such,
staking is somewhat "dynamic", with validators required to increase their stake proportionally to
the amount of storage and compute they commit to the network.
