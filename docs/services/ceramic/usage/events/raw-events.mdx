This section is dedicated to the lower-level functionality exposed by the `CeramicClient` class. For
most developers looking to get started with Ceramic, it's recommended to reference the
[Produce guide](/event-store/usage/produce) which uses models and model isntance documents.
Developers who wish to understand and work with lower-level event construction and publishing should
reference the current page.

If you've followed our [Getting Started guide](/event-store/usage/installation), you should have a
`CeramicClient` connected to a Ceramic node, as well as a `DID` that can sign and publish events.
We'll use these to create new signed events and submit them to the Ceramic network.

In the examples below, the `CeramicClient` is stored in a variable named `ceramic`, and the DID used
for publishing is in a variable named `publisherDID`. If you've used different names, please adjust
the examples to match your preferences.

## Publishing events

The `CeramicClient` includes a few methods for event publishing, most of which are convenience
wrappers around the fundamental `postEvent` method.

### `postEvent`

The foundational method for publishing events is `postEvent`, which accepts a binary event payload
that's been encoded into a string using the [multibase encoding standard][ref-multibase].

The event payload is a Content Archive or [CAR][ref-car], which contains "blocks" of
content-addressed data, including the event data and the signature from the publisher's DID. Soon
we'll learn how to produce events in the correct format, but for the example below, we'll assume
that you have already created an event and encoded it to a multibase string in the variable
`encodedEvent`:

```tsx
await ceramic.postEvent(encodedEvent);
```

The `postEvent` method returns a `Promise<void>` which resolves with no value on success, or throws
an `Exception` if the event submission fails. Because event ids are deterministic, there's no need
to wait for a response to know the identifier of the event. See the [event ids][docs-event-ids]
documentation for more about determining the id for an event or stream.

### `postEventCAR`

A convenience wrapper around [`postEvent`](#postevent) which accepts a [CAR][ref-car] JavaScript
object and encodes it to the string format that `postEvent` expects.

```tsx
import { eventToCAR } from "@ceramic-sdk/events";

// assume that we have an `eventData` object and an `eventCodec` that
// can encode and decode events of a particular type
const eventCAR = eventToCAR(eventCodec, eventData);

await ceramic.postEventCAR(eventCAR);
```

### `postEventType`

**This is the method most users will want to use to produce events on a stream.**

The `postEventType` method accepts event data in an arbitrary format, and uses a
[codeco](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/codeco) `Codec` to convert the event data into a properly
encoded CAR, which it then passes into [`postEvent`](#postevent).

```tsx
// assume that we have an `eventData` object and an `eventCodec` that
// can encode and decode events of a particular type

await ceramic.postEventType(eventCodec, eventData);
```

If you need access to the event data in CAR format before submitting it for publication, for example
to record the event id locally, you can call the `eventToCAR` method from the `@ceramic-sdk/events`
package and send the result to [`postEventCAR`](#posteventcar).

In the [Creating Events](#creating-events) section below, we'll see some of the built-in `Codec`s
provided by the `@ceramic-sdk/events` package, which can handle common event structures like Model
and Document creation and update events.

## Creating Events

Events can be constructed from either a string representation or a Content Addressable aRchive (CAR)
file. The `@ceramic-sdk/events` package provides two main functions for this purpose:
`eventFromString` and `eventFromCAR`.

### `signEvent`

The `signEvent` function is used to create a signed Ceramic event. It takes a DID (Decentralized
Identifier), a payload, and optional JWS creation options, and returns a `SignedEvent`.

<Steps>

<Step>

### Import functions and create a DID

```typescript
import { InitEventPayload, signEvent, signedEventToCAR } from "@ceramic-sdk/events";
import { StreamID } from "@ceramicnetwork/streamid";
import { getAuthenticatedDID } from "@didtools/key-did";

// Create an authenticated DID
const did = await getAuthenticatedDID(new Uint8Array(32));
```

### Construct an event payload

```typescript
// Create an event payload
const eventPayload: InitEventPayload = {
  data: null,
  header: {
    controllers: [did.id],
    model: StreamID.fromString("yourModelStreamID"),
    sep: "test",
  },
};
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Sign the payload

```typescript
// Encode the payload
const encodedPayload = InitEventPayload.encode(eventPayload);

// Sign the event
const signedEvent = await signEvent(did, encodedPayload);

console.log(signedEvent);
```

### Encode the Signed Event as CAR

```typescript
// Convert to an acceptable client payload for client.postEventCAR
const signedEventAsCar = signedEventToCAR(signedEvent);
```

</Step>

</Steps>

### `eventFromString`

The `eventFromString` function allows you to construct a Ceramic event from a string representation.
This is useful when you have received event data as a string, typically encoded in base64.

<Steps>

<Step>

### Import functions

```typescript
import { InitEventPayload, eventFromString } from "@ceramic-sdk/events";
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Decode the event

```typescript
// Assuming you have a base64 encoded string representation of an event
const encodedEvent = "base64EncodedEventString";

// Decode the event
const decodedEvent = eventFromString(InitEventPayload, encodedEvent);
```

### Inspect the decoded event

```typescript
// The decodedEvent will be either a SignedEvent or an InitEventPayload
if (SignedEvent.is(decodedEvent)) {
  console.log("This is a signed event");
} else {
  console.log("This is an unsigned event payload");
}
```

</Step>

</Steps>

### `eventFromCAR`

The `eventFromCAR` function allows you to construct a Ceramic event from a Content Addressable
aRchive (CAR).

<Steps>

<Step>

### Import functions and set up a DID

```typescript
import {
  InitEventPayload,
  SignedEvent,
  encodeEventToCAR,
  eventFromCAR,
  signedEventToCAR,
} from "@ceramic-sdk/events";
import { signEvent } from "@ceramic-sdk/events";
import { randomStreamID } from "@ceramic-sdk/identifiers";
import { asDIDString } from "@didtools/codecs";
import { getAuthenticatedDID } from "@didtools/key-did";

// Create an authenticated DID
const did = await getAuthenticatedDID(new Uint8Array(32));
```

### Construct and sign the CAR

```typescript
// Create a test event payload
const testEventPayload: InitEventPayload = {
  data: null,
  header: {
    controllers: [asDIDString(did.id)],
    model: randomStreamID(),
    sep: "test",
  },
};

// Encode the test payload
const encodedTestPayload = InitEventPayload.encode(testEventPayload);
const signedEvent = await signEvent(did, encodedTestPayload);
```

### Construct the event

```typescript
const event = eventFromCAR(InitEventPayload, unsignedCAR);
```

</Step>

</Steps>
