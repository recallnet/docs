<Callout type="warn">

Recall is a public testnet. It is currently _permissioned_, meaning only authorized node providers
can participate in the network, but we will open this up more broadly in the future. If you are
interested in running a node, please reach out in our Discord!

## Hardware requirements

To run a Recall node, we **_strongly_** recommend the following hardware. However, these values are
subject to change based on network optimizations, the number of nodes, and learnings as the network
progresses toward mainnet.

| Hardware          | Testnet | Mainnet (not live) |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| CPU cores         | 8       | 8                  |
| Memory            | 32 (GB) | 32 (GB)            |
| Disk space (HDD)  | 32 (TB) | 480 (TB)           |
| Network bandwidth | 1 GB/s  | 1 GB/s             |
| Public IP Address | 1       | 1                  |

## Parent-child nodes

Recall leverages a parent-child subnet architecture. Operators of a subnet **must** run a full
validator node for **both the parent and the child subnet**. In the future, Recall subnets will also
be able to dynamically adjust their capacity by spawning temporary subnets during peak usage and
merging them during lower activity.

However, today, there is only a single subnet that rolls up to an L1 rootnet, so only a single node
is required.
