## Overview

The Recall Agent Toolkit is designed to work with a variety of AI frameworks and approaches. This
flexibility allows you to build Recall-powered agents using the tools and libraries you're already
familiar with.

<Callout type="warning" title="Agent setup & storage requirements">

All Recall operations require tokens and credits. Before getting started, you'll need to:

1. Create an account with the [CLI](/tools/cli/account#create-an-account), or use an existing EVM
   wallet (e.g., export from MetaMask).
2. Get tokens from the [Recall Faucet](https://faucet.recall.network) for your wallet address.
3. Purchase credit for your account with the [Recall Portal](https://portal.recall.network) or the
   [CLI](/tools/cli/account#buy-credit).

## How MCP enables agent autonomy

Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for AI models to discover and invoke tools
autonomously. The key principles are:

1. **Tool registration**: Tools are made available to the model (e.g., Recall storage operations)
2. **Tool discovery**: The model learns what tools are available and how to use them
3. **Autonomous invocation**: The model decides when and how to use tools based on the context
4. **Result processing**: The model incorporates tool results into its reasoning

This creates a powerful paradigm where the AI agent, not the developer, decides when to access
Recall's storage capabilities based on the conversation or task.

## Choosing a framework

Each framework has its own strengths and use cases. Here's a quick comparison to help you decide:

| Framework                                | Best For                               | Key Features                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [MCP](/mcp-integration)                  | Claude, Cursor, direct LLM integration | Universal protocol, works with multiple clients                                       |
| [Mastra](/framework-guides/mastra)       | Agent development with memory          | Open-source TypeScript agent framework with memory, function execution and evaluation |
| [LangChain](/framework-guides/langchain) | Complex agent workflows, tool chaining | Extensive ecosystem, structured workflows                                             |
| [OpenAI](/framework-guides/openai)       | GPT integration, assistant API         | Simplest integration with OpenAI models                                               |
| [AI SDK](/framework-guides/ai-sdk)       | Web applications, Next.js              | Frontend integration, streaming responses                                             |
| [Eliza](/framework-guides/eliza)         | Simple rule-based agents               | Lightweight, no LLM dependencies                                                      |

For most users, we recommend starting with the MCP integration, which offers the broadest
compatibility with popular AI clients.

## Common integration pattern

While each framework has its own specific integration details, they all follow a similar pattern:

1. **Install the Agent Toolkit**
2. **Configure permissions and context**
3. **Initialize the framework-specific adapter**
4. **Provide Recall tools to the AI agent**
5. **The agent autonomously decides when to use Recall capabilities**

Here's a simplified example using the MCP adapter:

```typescript
// 1. Import the necessary packages
import { RecallAgentToolkit } from "@recallnet/agent-toolkit/mcp";
import { Agent } from "@your-framework/agent";
// Note: This is a placeholder for the actual agent framework you're using
import { MCPConfiguration } from "@your-framework/mcp";

// 2. Configure permissions
const recallToolkit = new RecallAgentToolkit({
  privateKey: process.env.RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY,
  configuration: {
    actions: {
      account: { read: true },
      bucket: { read: true, write: true },
    },
  },
});

// 3. Initialize the adapter
const mcp = new MCPConfiguration({
  servers: {
    recall: {
      name: "recall-storage",
      server: recallToolkit,
    },
  },
});

// 4. Create agent with tools
const agent = new Agent({
  model: "gpt-4",
  tools: await mcp.getTools(),
  instructions: "You have access to Recall storage capabilities.",
});

// 5. Agent autonomously decides when to use tools
const result = await agent.run("Store today's meeting notes for me");
```

## Custom integrations

If you're using a framework that's not directly supported, you can still use the Recall Agent
Toolkit. The toolkit's shared components provide a framework-agnostic API that you can use to build
your own integration.

Check out the [custom integration guide](/framework-guides/custom) for more details.
