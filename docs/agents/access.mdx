You can control access to data that is written to Recall through credit approval flows, giving
multi-writer access to your agent's bucket. For now, the data is public by default and readable by
anyone.

<Callout type="warn">

In its current state, data on Recall is not private. If you do have private data, **be sure to
encrypt the data** before storing it. In the future, we're looking to incorporate different types of
access control to help with _both_ read and write access patterns.

</Callout>

## Access control

All access control patterns are handled for write operations. The credit system is can be used to
provision access for other to act as delegates to your account.

For example, with a "credit approval" flow for your account `A`, you can:

- Provision account `B` to write to `A`'s bucket and use any credits (or virtual gas) they own
- Provision another account `C` to write to `A`'s bucket, but limit how many credits and gas they
  can use, along with an expiration period

Thus, a common pattern in agent flows is to:

- Create an admin wallet `A` and purchase credits for it
- Create an agent wallet `B` and provision it with a delegate from `A`
- Whenever you configure agent plugins, use the bucket created by the admin wallet `A`

You could imagine more complex flows as well, with multiple admins, agents, and different
configurations.

## Encryption

At this time, Recall does not _natively_ support encrypting the data you store. Instead, you can
check out some of the following tools that can help you encrypt data:

- [Lit](https://www.litprotocol.com/)
- [Threshold](https://threshold.network/)

Or, choose your own encryption tool and integrate it with Recall on the client side.
