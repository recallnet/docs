OrbisDB is built on top of decentralized components such as DIDs and Models. Despite being new,
these concepts have been made easy to use thanks to OrbisDB abstractions and a Web2-like DX.

## Accounts (DIDs)

OrbisDB utilizes decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for account management. Each entry in the OrbisDB
is verifiably owned by its original author - a trait inherited from Ceramic. DIDs bring this to
another level, allowing users to own their identity in full. They are self-verifiable, so you can
prove your identity (and data ownership) with no 3rd parties involved.

Learn more in the [Accounts section](/databases/orbisdb-managing-data/accounts).

## Models (Tables)

Composable data requires rules. Applications and users need to understand the data to consume it.
Models are a way for you to define your OrbisDB tables using standard JSON Schema. This helps
OrbisDB build out the tables, indexes and relations required. It also allows you to control the data
format, structure and rules - making it easy for anyone to consume.

Find out how to create your first Table in our
[Models section](/databases/orbisdb-managing-data/models).

## Contexts (Spaces)

Data in today's world is already complex enough. However, bringing data to an open and composable
network is a challenge in itself. Contexts and Sub-Contexts are an OrbisDB (and Ceramic) native way
of organizing data. Think of them as separate "Spaces" in your OrbisDB. They help OrbisDB sift
through data to index, but also allow isolation for things such as
[Plugins](/databases/orbisdb-plugins).

Learn how data organization works in our
[Contexts section](/databases/orbisdb-managing-data/contexts).

## Queries

We were determined to bring a familiar developer experience to the web3. This is one of the reasons
our indexing is backed by PostgreSQL. However, there's more to it than just the choice of
technologies. Our SDK methods should feel just as familiar, whether you're interacting with our
underlying data network (Ceramic) or OrbisDB directly.

### INSERT & UPDATE

Writing data to a decentralized data network is one function call away - literally. Learn how
`INSERTs` and `UPDATEs` work in OrbisDB in our [Writing](/databases/orbisdb-managing-data/insert)
and [Updating](/databases/orbisdb-managing-data/update) data sections.

### SELECT

When querying already-indexed data, you're interfacing with OrbisDB directly. Whether you prefer a
query builder, raw SQL or GraphQL - OrbisDB got you covered.
