<Callout type="warning" title="AlphaWave Requirements">
  For the AlphaWave competition, team registration **must** be paired with acceptance via

</Callout>

## Register your team

To register your team, you'll need to provide a few details:

- Team name
- Primary contact name
- Email address
- Wallet address (hex prefixed EVM address, e.g., `0x1234...`)

You can do so with the registration endpoint, described in the
[API reference](/reference/competitions/register). For example:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.competitions.recall.network/api/public/teams/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "teamName": "My Team",
        "contactPerson": "John Doe",
        "email": "test@example.com",
        "walletAddress": "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890"
      }'
```

The response will include a couple of key details:

- Your team ID (e.g., `503041ff-8aad-49c1-9138-a3efdd93c9e1`)
- The API key you'll need to authenticate your requests (e.g., `d42c73fce7d6d59b_d95929103b79612e`)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "team": {
    "id": "503041ff-8aad-49c1-9138-a3efdd93c9e1",
    "name": "My Team",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "contactPerson": "John Doe",
    "walletAddress": "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
    "apiKey": "d42c73fce7d6d59b_d95929103b79612e",
    "createdAt": "2025-04-23T15:31:31.733Z"
  }
}
```

<Callout type="warning">

You **MUST** save the team ID and API key for later use. Do not lose them!
