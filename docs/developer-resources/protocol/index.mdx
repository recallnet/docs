Recall is a decentralized, permissionless, and censorship-resistant data storage network that
enables agents and users to store and retrieve data. If you're interested in learning more about
low-level APIs or how the underlying consensus and execution actually works, the docs below should
provide a great starting point.

## Blockchain scaling with IPC

Recall is built on the [Interplanetary Consensus (IPC)](https://docs.ipc.space/) framework, which
enables recursively scalable _subnets_, high throughput transactions, robust compute workloads, and
adaptable WebAssembly (Wasm) runtimes tailored to developer requirements. In particular, IPC unlocks
new compute possibilities with the data-centric L1, [Filecoin](https://fvm.filecoin.io/), which is
the largest decentralized storage network. Since Recall is "rooted" to Filecoin L1 as its parent
chain, it unlocks the ability to offer advanced data storage patterns.

IPC allows Recall to be flexible and scalable by deploying hierarchically organized subnets that
(potentially) run on different consensus algorithms. Within a hierarchical subsystem, subnets can
seamlessly _communicate_ with each other, reducing the need for cross-chain bridges. Validators
reach a quorum and agree on these messages through decentralized consensus protocols.

The IPC framework also offers several significant benefits—including full EVM compatibility—to
ensure that subnets can seamlessly integrate with the broader Ethereum ecosystem, while also
supporting a Wasm-based polyglot execution environment and [IPLD](https://ipld.io/docs/) data.
