To make data composable, there need to be rules. Models help OrbisDB and other applications in the
ecosystem understand the data that's coming in.

## Definition

Models are a Ceramic-native concept used to determine the way data is created and how it relates to
other data. They utilize [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) to define data types, validation
rules and the overall shape of data. Models also contain additional information, such as `relations`
which help build robust relational data systems.

A basic Model definition is as follows

```json
{
  "name": "Model name",
  "views": {},
  "schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "$defs": {},
    "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
    "required": [], // Required fields
    "properties": {} // Keys, values and their data types
    },
    "additionalProperties": false
  },
  "version": "2.0",
  "interface": false,
  "relations": {}, // If any of the keys are related to other data
  "implements": [],
  "immutableFields": [],
  "description": "Model description",
  "accountRelation": {
    "type": "list | single | set" // Account relation type
  }
}
```

## Account Relation

Account Relations define the number of entries per account. You should view them as table
constraints. There are 3 Account Relations available: `list` (default), `single`, `set`.

#### List (unlimited)

This is the default Account Relation and means the author can add as many entries as they want.

#### Set (one per value)

This Account Relation can be viewed as `UNIQUE (account, ...fields)`. Only a single entry per author
and unique field value can be created.

An example use case is product reviews in which case each user should only be able to leave 1 review
per product. If the user were to try and add another review for an existing product, the original
review would be updated. However, they would be able to post reviews on other products as expected.

#### Single (one)

As the name suggests, this Account Relation ensures only a single entry per Account can be created.
This is tied to the Model, so a user can only create a single entry for this Model across all apps
and Contexts. In SQL-ish format, this would be equal to `UNIQUE (account, model)`.

An example use case would be a user profile shared across the ecosystem. If the user were to try and
create a new entry, instead of adding a new row, the original one would be updated.

## Models in OrbisDB

Similar to SQL Tables, Models define the way data is structured. It's due to this common property
between the two that OrbisDB creates **a table per Model**. OrbisDB subscribes to Models in the same
fashion consumers subscribe to topics.

Bear this in mind when creating your Models and treat them as `CREATE TABLE` statements. Combine
them with [Contexts](/databases/orbisdb-managing-data/contexts) to create composable organized data.

There's a lot of Models already out there, so you might want to reconsider creating your own. Check
out the most popular Models using [Cerscan](https://cerscan.com/mainnet/leaderboard).

### Model aliases

Models get an automatically generated name, 63 seemingly random letters and numbers. Since the
developer experience of using tables with long random names is pretty far from what we're used to in
Web2, we decided to add Model aliases. This feature allows you to use friendly table names which
will get mapped to the correct Model IDs when running queries, both read and write.

### Data type mapping

Each unique Model property is mapped to a PostgreSQL column based on its data type. This determines
the operators that can be used when querying data.

The following data type mappings are currently supported.

| JSON Schema | PostgreSQL |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| string      | TEXT       |
| number      | NUMERIC    |
| integer     | INTEGER    |
| boolean     | BOOLEAN    |
| object      | JSONB      |
| array       | JSONB      |
| date        | DATE       |
| datetime    | TIMESTAMP  |
| uuid        | UUID       |
| binary      | BYTEA      |
| (unknown)   | TEXT       |

If no appropriate mapping can be found, `TEXT` will be used.

## Creating Models

Thanks to OrbisDB you don't have to understand most of the above to write your first row of data.
Use our built-in Model Creator (link) which lets you build and publish Models using UI. Not a single
line of code required.
