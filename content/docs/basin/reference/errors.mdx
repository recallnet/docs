## Actor cannot be found

An actor _must_ be registered on a subnet before it can be used. Basin runs on a subnet, which is a
separate chain on top of the "root" Filecoin chain. Accounts only exist there if they've been sent a
transaction on the subnet, which effectively "creates" the account on the subnet with underlying FVM
EVM account manager logic.

```
Error: failed to init sequence; actor ... cannot be found
```

If you see this error, you can either:

- Deposit funds into your subnet account from the rootnet (Filecoin).
- Transfer funds from an _existing_ account that has been used on the subnet to your new account.

Both of these operations can be performed with the Basin CLI.
