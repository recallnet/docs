description: Learn how to update data in OrbisDB.
---

When updating data in OrbisDB, users are interacting with the underlying decentralized data network,
Ceramic. Find out more about the data flow in our
[Updating data section](/databases/orbisdb-managing-data/update).

> Before using the methods, make sure to [initialize](/databases/orbisdb-sdk-reference) your OrbisDB
> SDK and [authenticate](/databases/orbisdb-sdk-reference/auth) the user.

## Syntax

OrbisDB updates can perform full or partial row updates.

> OrbisDB statements work on the principle of "method chaining" to build and eventually execute the
> query.

### Replace a row

When replacing a row, you need to provide all the required fields (based on the
[Model](/databases/orbisdb-managing-data/models)).

```tsx
const result = await orbis
  .update("ROW_ID")
  .replace({
    column: value,
    column2: value2,
  })
  .run();
```

### Update a row partially

Partial row updates will perform a shallow merge of the updated content and the original row.
`{ ...new_content, ...original_row }`

```tsx
const result = await orbis
  .update("ROW_ID")
  .set({
    column: value,
  })
  .run();
```

## Contexts

`UPDATE` statements can't be Context-scoped as the row itself either belongs to a Context or
doesn't.

## Statement execution

You do not have to execute the statement immediately. It's done by either chaining the `.run()` or
executing it later.

If you decide to postpone the execution, you can access a history of all query runs by accessing the
`statement.runs` property.

### Immediate execution

```tsx
const result = await orbis
  .update("ROW_ID")
  .replace({
    column: value,
    column2: value2,
  })
  .run();
```

### Postponed execution

```tsx
const statement = orbis.update("ROW_ID").replace({
  column: value,
  column2: value2,
});

const result = await statement.run();

console.log(result);

// Log the execution history of this statement
console.log(statement.runs);
```

## Local validation

Unlike `INSERT` statements, `UPDATEs` don't have local validation implemented, yet. Validation will
be done by the Ceramic node.
