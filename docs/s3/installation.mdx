The `basin_s3` binary is a simple adapter that allows you to use the Basin object storage system
with S3-compatibility. Let's walk through how to set it up, and subsequent pages walk through how to
use it with ancillary tools S3 like MinIO.

### Setup

<Steps>

<Step>

### Install

First, clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/recallnet/basin-s3
```

Then, `cd` into `basin-s3` and install the adapter binary:

```sh
make install
```

This should make `basin_s3` available in your path, which you can verify with `basin_s3 --version`.

</Step>

<Step>

### Run the adapter

Starting the Basin S3 adapter uses port `8014` by default. There are three required flags:

- `--private-key`: Hex encoded, Ethereum-style private key (ECDSA, secp256k1) for sending
  transactions (environment variable: `PRIVATE_KEY`).
- `--network`: The network to connect to (environment variable: `NETWORK`).
- `--access-key`: An S3 access key (e.g,. `AKEXAMPLES3S`)
- `--secret-key`: An S3 secret key (e.g., `SKEXAMPLES3S`)

```sh
basin_s3 --private-key [your_private_key] --access-key AKEXAMPLES3S --secret-key SKEXAMPLES3S
```

The access key and secret aren't used for anything other than matching the MinIO client
configuration. If you want to do read-only queries, simply omit the private key. Alternatvely, you
can run it directly with `cargo run`:

```sh
cargo run --features binary -- --private-key [your_private_key] --access-key AKEXAMPLES3S --secret-key SKEXAMPLES3S
```

<Callout type="info">

If you do not already have a private key, you can generate one with the Recall CLI. You also _must_
make sure your account exists on the subnet, which requires you have deposited funds into your
subnet account. Neglecting this step will lead to errors like
`failed to init sequence; actor ... cannot be found`.

</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

### Create an aliased bucket

Bucket usage slightly deviates from how you typically would in S3. This happens due to how the S3
adapter works alongside Basin by using aliases stored in metadata to help identify the bucket name
and its relationship with onchain buckets owned by the creator. To interact with any bucket, the
name you define is always prefixed by the creator's public key (i.e., EVM hex address), delimited by
a period.

The general format is `<0x_address>.<bucket_name>`. For example, if you create a bucket called
`my-store` with the private key `0x...`, the actual bucket name will be
`0x90f79bf6eb2c4f870365e785982e1f101e93b906.my-store`. Subsequent examples will describe this in
more detail with respect to the client that is used.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Next steps

You can now use Basin with any S3-compatible tooling! The example below walks through how to use it
with an S3-compatible CLI tool like MinIO, which is demonstrated in the ensuing page. But, its
compatibility extends to any S3-compatible client or library (e.g.,
[ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/), etc.).
