# Contexts (Spaces)

OrbisDB is made for decentralized data, lots of it. Contexts help you organize it in a way
meaningful to your project or application.

## Organizing data

Contexts are an OrbisDB and Ceramic native term. They let you divide and organize data in any way
you want, think of them as different “spaces” in your OrbisDB.

> _Contexts_ can have _Sub-Contexts_, allowing for fine-grained control and a tree-like structure.

As they are a part of the original Ceramic event, Contexts will be used to determine which data to
index and how, providing an opportunity for compute optimization.

## Isolation

Contexts are used for more than organization, they also serve as a level of isolation.
[Plugins](/databases/orbisdb-plugins) are defined on Context basis, allowing for granular control
over things like access gating, data validation, metadata and more.

## Use cases

OrbisDB Contexts are often used to define projects or apps, as well as their internal data
organization. An example may be an AI training app (Context) which separates datasets (Sub-Contexts)
based on semantics or source, even though they share the same
[data model](/databases/orbisdb-managing-data/models).

## Managing Contexts

Context management is currently done through the OrbisDB Dashboard, only. To learn how to utilize
them, check out the [Dashboard Reference](/databases/orbisdb-dashboard-reference).

## Contexts in OrbisDB

Each OrbisDB entry has an additional `_metadata_context` field that's read from the Ceramic event
directly. This field will be used when writing or reading data from a specific Context and it will
help determine the rules based on the Context itself.

When using the SDK, an additional `context` param can be passed. This will automatically be used in
the read or write query to filter or write data to the specified Context. Check out more in the
[SDK Reference](/databases/orbisdb-sdk-reference).
