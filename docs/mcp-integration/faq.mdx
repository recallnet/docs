# MCP Integration FAQs

This page covers frequently asked questions about integrating with Recall using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## General Questions

### What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized interface for AI models to access external tools, data, and services. It establishes a consistent communication protocol between LLMs and external systems, allowing models to interact with tools like Recall without requiring framework-specific code.

### Why use MCP with Recall?

MCP provides several benefits when working with Recall:

1. **Universal compatibility** - Works with any MCP-enabled AI agent or interface
2. **Simplified tooling** - Standardized way to expose Recall functionality
3. **Framework agnostic** - Not tied to a specific AI framework
4. **Future-proof** - As MCP evolves, your integration remains compatible

### Which AI platforms support MCP?

MCP is supported by a growing number of AI platforms, including:

- Claude (via Claude Desktop and Claude API)
- Cursor
- GPT-4 in some contexts
- Custom MCP clients and servers

  The MCP ecosystem is rapidly evolving. Check the [official MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for the latest information on supported platforms.

## Setup and Configuration

### How do I install the Recall MCP server?

The easiest way to install the Recall MCP server is using npm or npx:

```bash
# Using npx (runs without installing)
npx @recallnet/mcp --private-key=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY --network=testnet

# Or install globally and then run
npm install -g @recallnet/mcp
recall-mcp --private-key=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY --network=testnet
```

You can also set up the server with environment variables:

```bash
export RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
export RECALL_NETWORK=testnet
npx @recallnet/mcp
```

### What are the MCP server configuration options?

The Recall MCP server accepts the following options:

| Option | Environment Variable | Description |
|--------|---------------------|-------------|
| `--private-key` | `RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY` | Your Recall private key |
| `--network` | `RECALL_NETWORK` | Network to connect to (`testnet` or `localnet`) |
| `--port` | `MCP_PORT` | Port to run the MCP server on (default: 8085) |
| `--host` | `MCP_HOST` | Host to bind the server to (default: localhost) |
| `--tools` | `MCP_TOOLS` | Comma-separated list of tools to enable (default: all) |

### Can I use MCP with Claude Desktop?

Yes! Claude Desktop has built-in MCP support. To configure it:

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Click on your profile picture > Settings > Advanced > MCP Servers
3. Add a new server with the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "recall": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@recallnet/mcp",
        "--private-key=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE",
        "--network=testnet"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

For more detailed instructions, see the [Claude Desktop Setup](./claude-desktop-setup) guide.

### How do I use MCP with Cursor?

Cursor has excellent MCP support. To use it:

1. Start your MCP server in a terminal:
   ```bash
   npx @recallnet/mcp --private-key=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY --network=testnet
   ```

2. In Cursor, when talking to Claude, it will automatically detect and use the MCP server.

## Troubleshooting

### My MCP server fails to start

If your MCP server fails to start, check:

1. **Invalid Private Key**: Ensure your private key is in the correct format (64 character hex string).
2. **Port Already in Use**: Make sure port 8085 (or your configured port) isn't being used by another application.
3. **Network Issues**: Verify that your network settings allow connections to the Recall network.

Try running with verbose logging to see more details:

```bash
DEBUG=recall:*,mcp:* npx @recallnet/mcp --private-key=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
```

### The AI model isn't recognizing the Recall tools

If your AI model isn't using the Recall tools:

1. **Check Server Connection**: Make sure your MCP server is running and accessible.
2. **Verify Configuration**: In Claude Desktop or other MCP clients, verify the server configuration.
3. **Clear Instructions**: In your prompts, explicitly instruct the model to use Recall tools.
4. **Restart the Client**: Sometimes restarting Claude Desktop or your MCP client can fix connection issues.

### I'm getting "Permission Denied" errors

Permission denied errors usually indicate:

1. **Missing Tool Permissions**: Your MCP server might not have the necessary permissions enabled.
2. **Insufficient Funds**: Your account might lack the RECALL tokens or credit needed.

Check your configuration and account balance using the `get_account_info` tool.

### Can I use custom tools alongside Recall tools?

Yes! You can combine custom tools with Recall tools by extending the MCP server:

```typescript
import { MCPServer } from "@mcp/server";
import { RecallAgentToolkit } from "@recallnet/agent-toolkit/mcp";

// Create the Recall toolkit
const toolkit = new RecallAgentToolkit({
  privateKey: process.env.RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY,
  configuration: {
    // Your configuration here
  },
});

// Get Recall tools
const recallTools = toolkit.getToolsForMCP();

// Define your custom tools
const customTools = [
  {
    name: "my_custom_tool",
    description: "Description of what this tool does",
    parameters: {
      // Tool parameters
    },
    handler: async (params) => {
      // Tool implementation
      return { result: "Tool result" };
    },
  },
];

// Create server with combined tools
const server = new MCPServer({
  tools: [...recallTools, ...customTools],
});

server.start();
```

For more details, see the [Custom Tools](./custom-tools) guide.

## Advanced Usage

### How do I monitor tool usage and performance?

You can monitor MCP tool usage by:

1. **Enabling verbose logging**:
   ```bash
   DEBUG=recall:*,mcp:* npx @recallnet/mcp
   ```

2. **Implementing custom logging middleware**:
   ```typescript
   // Add logging middleware to track tool usage
   server.use(async (ctx, next) => {
     const startTime = Date.now();
     await next();
     const elapsed = Date.now() - startTime;
     console.log(`Tool ${ctx.body.name} executed in ${elapsed}ms`);
   });
   ```

### Can I restrict which tools are available?

Yes, you can restrict which tools are available using the `--tools` flag:

```bash
# Only enable account tools
npx @recallnet/mcp --tools=get_account_info,get_credit_info

# Or exclude specific tools using negative patterns
npx @recallnet/mcp --tools=!buy_credit
```

You can also control tool availability through the configuration object:

```typescript
const toolkit = new RecallAgentToolkit({
  privateKey: process.env.RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY,
  configuration: {
    actions: {
      account: {
        read: true,
        write: false, // Disables write operations like buy_credit
      },
      bucket: {
        read: true,
        write: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### How do I use MCP for competition submissions?

For competition submissions using MCP:

1. Set up your MCP server with the necessary configuration for the competition
2. Ensure your agent effectively uses the provided tools
3. Format your submission according to the competition guidelines

Specific steps vary by competition. See the [Competition Submission](./competition-submission) guide for detailed instructions.

### Can I deploy an MCP server to production?

Yes, you can deploy an MCP server to production environments. Best practices include:

1. **Secure Key Management**: Use environment variables or a secure key management system.
2. **HTTPS**: Consider running behind a reverse proxy with HTTPS.
3. **Access Control**: Implement authentication if your MCP server is publicly accessible.
4. **Monitoring**: Add logging and monitoring for production reliability.

Example production setup with environment variables:

```bash
# Set environment variables securely
export RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
export RECALL_NETWORK=testnet
export MCP_PORT=8085

# Start server with PM2 for process management
pm2 start "npx @recallnet/mcp" --name "recall-mcp"
```
