OrbisDB SDK is an [open-source](https://github.com/OrbisWeb3/db-sdk) Typescript module available on
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@useorbis/db-sdk).

## Installation

You can install OrbisDB SDK with any package manager that supports the
[NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@useorbis/db-sdk)

```bash
npm install @useorbis/db-sdk
```

## Initialize the SDK

OrbisDB requires some basic configuration to work, mainly Ceramic and OrbisDB node gateways. There's
a slight difference based on the type of an instance you're connecting to. Learn more about instance
types [here](/databases/orbisdb-setting-up).

### Dedicated instance

> When running OrbisDB and Ceramic locally, your gateways are\
> **Ceramic** - `http://localhost:7007`\
> **OrbisDB** - `http://localhost:7008`

> If you're not self-hosting the instance, your information should be made available by your
> provider.

```tsx
import { OrbisDB } from "@useorbis/db-sdk";

const db = new OrbisDB({
  ceramic: {
    gateway: "YOUR_CERAMIC_NODE_URL",
  },
  nodes: [
    {
      gateway: "YOUR_ORBIS_NODE_URL",
    },
  ],
});
```

### Shared instance

When using a shared instance, such as
[OrbisDB Studio](/databases/orbisdb-setting-up/managed-studio), you must provide an environment to
connect to.

#### Environments

Shared OrbisDB instances are multi-tenant nodes that can host multiple, isolated, projects on a
single node. All environments share the same underlying hardware, network and Ceramic node, but are
logically separate with isolated databases, admins and configurations.

> You can find your [OrbisDB Studio](/databases/orbisdb-setting-up/managed-studio) gateways on the
> home (Contexts) page. > If you're using a 3rd party provider, they should provide the information.

```tsx
import { OrbisDB } from "@useorbis/db-sdk";

const db = new OrbisDB({
  ceramic: {
    gateway: "YOUR_CERAMIC_NODE_URL",
  },
  nodes: [
    {
      gateway: "YOUR_ORBIS_NODE_URL",
      env: "YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_ID",
    },
  ],
});
```
