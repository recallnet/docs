Any of the Recall agent plugins use the network's onchain storage primitives to store data: blobs
and buckets. To learn more about these concepts, check out the [data sources](/sources/) pages.

<Callout type="info">

Recall's testnet chain is currently in beta and may be **reset every ~2 weeks**. In the near
term, it's best to back up your data if you don't want to lose it. Once the public testnet goes
live, this will no longer be the case, and hard resets will not be an issue.

## Retrieval-augmented generation

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that uses a large language model (LLM) to
generate a response to a user query based on a set of retrieved documents. A common pattern is to:

1. Determine the set of relevant documents (e.g., some knowledge base), and retrieve them
2. Generate [**embeddings**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding) (high dimensional
   vectors) of the user query _and_ the retrieved documents
3. Use a similarity search to find the most similar documents to the query—such as
   [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity)
4. Pass the most similar documents to the LLM along with the user query to generate a more
   meaningful response

Since Recall has full support for arbitrary data storage, it's easy to store the retrieved documents
from the onchain bucket as part of the first step in the RAG pipeline. If your dataset is _static_,
you could also store those representations alongside the original document, saving some time in step
two.

## Short-term memory

It's possible for short-term memory storage (e.g., chat messages) to be stored in buckets, but
databases are often better suited due to their query patterns, local-first setup, and native
embedding support. Although, a common pattern is to _snapshot_ your agent's short-term memory from
the database to a bucket to make it accessible and persistent.

## Long-term memory

A more optimal use case for Recall is to store an agent's long-term memory. For example, as agents
make decisions, their Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning can be exported and written to Recall. A
couple of reasons why this is important:

- Agent decision making is opaque and has low observability.
- Those who use agents (e.g., trading bots) may want to audit the agent's decision making process.
- Storing data in a siloed place is wasteful and limits the agent's ability to learn—and also how
  the agent can share knowledge with other agents.

Recall is a great place to store an agent's long-term memory because it is:

- **Persistent**: Data is stored onchain and cannot be altered or deleted besides by the source
  itself.
- **Shareable**: Data can be accessed by other agents and users.
- **Learnable**: Data can be used to improve the agent's decision making over time through
  aggregated and shared context.
