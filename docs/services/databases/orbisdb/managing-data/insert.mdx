Using OrbisDB to write data should feel just as natural as it does with a Web2 database.

## Flow of data (`INSERT`)

OrbisDB is built on top of Ceramic, a decentralized event store. In order to inherit Ceramic's
properties such as data ownership, integrity and verifiability, we use Ceramic as our ingestion
layer.

When writing data to OrbisDB, end users interact with Ceramic directly, making them the true
controllers - nobody else can modify their data. You also need to specify the
[Model](/databases/orbisdb-managing-data/models) to which the data will adhere.

Once written to Ceramic, all OrbisDB instances subscribed to a Model used will get a notification
and begin the indexing process. This includes [Context](/databases/orbisdb-managing-data/contexts)
checks, validation done by [Plugins](/databases/orbisdb-plugins), etc.

Indexed data is then queried from OrbisDB directly, but is linked to the underlying Ceramic data via
the `Stream ID`.

## `INSERT` in OrbisDB

Two main sources of writes exist in OrbisDB: users and plugins.

### Users

This is the main way data gets written to OrbisDB, as it represents your end users. Thanks to the
SDK abstraction, there's a simple ORM-like approach to writing data. To write the data, you'll be
using `insert` and `insertBulk` [methods](/databases/orbisdb-sdk-reference/insert).

### Plugins

Plugins can generate data on their own. This data is signed by your node and can be used for
purposes such as bringing data from outside sources (APIs, webhooks) or generating reports based on
certain rules.

Example Plugins using this functionality: CSV Uploader and API Data Source.

### Encrypted data

Since OrbisDB uses Ceramic as its ingestion layer, **all data needs to be encrypted client-side** -
before being written to Ceramic. OrbisDB will respect the
[Model](/databases/orbisdb-managing-data/models) definition when indexing the data, however, it will
be indexed as-is. No decryption attempts will be made. Decryption will have to happen client-side or
via [Plugins](/databases/orbisdb-plugins).

An example of a client-side decentralized encryption scheme is
[Lit Protocol](https://www.litprotocol.com/).

### Code examples

> [Model aliases](/databases/orbisdb-managing-data/models) can be used when writing data, allowing
> for a better developer experience

#### Single insert

```jsx
// OrbisDB has been initialized
// orbis.connectUser has been used to authenticate the user

const result = await orbis
  .insert("MODEL_ID" | "MODEL_ALIAS")
  .value({
    column: value,
    column2: value2,
  })
  // optionally, you can scope this insert to a specific context
  .context("CONTEXT_ID")
  .run();
```

#### Bulk insert

```jsx
// OrbisDB has been initialized
// orbis.connectUser has been used to authenticate the user

const { success, errors } = await orbis
  .bulkInsert("MODEL_ID" | "MODEL_ALIAS")
  .values(
    {
      column: value,
      column2: value2,
    },
    {
      column: value,
      column2: value2,
    }
  )
  .run();

// bulkStatements DO NOT throw in case a run partially fails
// As each insert is handled as an isolated case, you may have partial success
if (errors.length) {
  console.error("Errors occurred during execution", errors);
}

console.log(success);
```

#### Local Model validation

If you wish to validate the data before submitting it, you can use the built-in JSON Schema
validator.

```jsx
// OrbisDB has been initialized
// orbis.connectUser has been used to authenticate the user

const insertStatement = await orbis.insert("MODEL_ID" | "MODEL_ALIAS").value({
  column: value,
  column2: value2,
});

// Perform local JSON Schema validation before running the query
const validation = await insertStatement.validate();
if (!validation.valid) {
  throw "Error during validation: " + validation.error;
}

const result = await insertStatement.run();
```

## Summary

When writing data, Ceramic is used as the source of truth from which OrbisDB Nodes index new data.
Inserts are as simple as `orbis.insert`.

The general flow when writing data looks like this:

1. End user creates and signs the data (SDK)
2. The data is sent to Ceramic by the end user directly (SDK)
3. OrbisDB picks up and processes Ceramic events
4. Plugins are used to validate and enrich the data
5. If the data passes all the checks, it's then organized and stored in PostgreSQL
6. Plugins get the final state of data, allowing them to do post-processing operations
