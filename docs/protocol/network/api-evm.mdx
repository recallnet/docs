description: Endpoints for interacting with the Recall network's EVM API.

Recall is fully EVM compatible. You can deploy smart contracts as you would on any other chain, but
many of the true unlocks are at the underlying Wasm runtime. Regardless, most of the EVM RPC calls
are supported.

<Callout type="info">

Make sure you _do not_ use the Cancun EVM version. This adds transient storage opcodes, which
currently are not supported. Instead, use the Paris EVM version.

## Base URL

The EVM API endpoints for each of the Recall chain environments are listed below:

- `testnet`: `https://evm.v013.node-0.testnet.recall.network`
- `localnet` or `devnet`: `http://127.0.0.1:8645`

The parent chain RPCs for Recall are the following. These are only relevant if you're working with
cross chain operations (e.g., deposits or withdrawals) or validator actions (i.e., node operator
actions).

- `testnet`: Uses Filecoin Calibration (e.g., `https://api.calibration.node.glif.io/rpc/v1`)
- `localnet`: Uses Anvil (`http://127.0.0.1:8545`)

## Gas settings

When you deploy to a subnet, the default gas parameters used may be too low, leading to problems. If
you run into this issue, EVM libraries give you the ability to override the gas settings.

For example, with `forge` where `-g` is shorthand for `--gas-estimate-multiplier`:

```
forge script ... -g 100000
```

This will increase the estimate multiplier to `100000`, which overrides the default of `120`.
