The Basin faucet is a free service that drips subnet tokens to your wallet. Note that it is rate
limited and will give you 5 tokens per request.

### Request funds

Once connected, you'll be able to input your wallet address and request funds. Upon success, a
notification will show the transaction hash. It should take a matter of seconds before they funds
are available in your account.

### Start building

Now that you have funds in your wallet, you're all set to start building on Basin! Be sure to use
the same private key you used to sign up for the faucet when you use tools like the Studio, CLI, or
any other Hoku tooling.
