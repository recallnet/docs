description: Low-level SDKs for complete control of Recall's functionality
---

Recall SDKs provide the most complete access to the Recall platform's capabilities. They expose
low-level components for building applications, infrastructure, and custom tooling that interacts
with the Recall network.

<Callout type="info">
  If you're building an AI agent, consider using the [Agent Toolkit](/agents/build-your-agent/agent-toolkit) first, as it
  provides a simplified API designed specifically for agent development. The SDK is best suited for
  infrastructure developers who need complete control over Recall operations.
</Callout>

## Language support

To determine if the SDK is right for your project, see our [Tools Comparison Guide](/developer-resources/tools). Recall
currently offers SDKs in two languages:

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="JavaScript/TypeScript"
    href="/developer-resources/tools/sdk/javascript"
    description="Build Node.js or web applications with the Recall API in JS/TS"
  />
  <Card
    title="Rust"
    href="/developer-resources/tools/sdk/rust"
    description="Build high-performance applications with the Recall API in Rust"
  />
</Cards>

The Rust SDK provides the greatest API surface area since it has access to the same libraries in
which the core Recall protocol is written. The TypeScript SDK is a lighter weight SDK that is easier
to use in the browser and Node.js environments.

## When to use the SDK

The SDK is the right choice when:

- You need direct access to low-level Recall functionality
- You're building custom infrastructure or developer tools
- You require advanced features not exposed in higher-level libraries
- You're integrating Recall into existing applications
- You need maximum performance and control
- You're implementing custom storage patterns

## SDK vs. AgentToolkit

| SDK                                   | Agent Toolkit                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Complete API access                   | Focused on agent-specific operations |
| More complex setup                    | Simple framework-specific adapters   |
| Advanced configuration options        | Streamlined configuration            |
| Raw data structures                   | Agent-friendly abstractions          |
| Manual integration with AI frameworks | Built-in framework adapters          |

## Core SDK features

The SDKs provide access to all Recall functionality:

- **Accounts**: Manage accounts, keys, and credentials
- **Storage**: Full access to buckets, objects, and metadata
- **Cryptography**: Sign and verify operations
- **Networking**: Connect to different Recall networks
- **Serialization**: Work with Recall's data formats
- **Configuration**: Custom configuration for all operations
