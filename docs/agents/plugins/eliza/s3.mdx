title: S3 plugin
description: Use S3-compatible storage with your Eliza agent.
---

The Eliza S3 plugin comes by default in its `plugin-node` plugin, which is widely used for its
multi-purpose tools and actions.

<Steps>

<Step>

## Installation

You can either choose to clone the [Eliza starter kit](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza-starter.git)
and use one of their examples, or you can install the dependencies directly. We'll run through the
latter.

First, install core Eliza packages, including `@elizaos/plugin-node` for the S3 plugin, and a couple
other packages (for database setup, environment variables, etc.):

```package-install
npm install @elizaos/core @elizaos/plugin-node @elizaos/client-direct @elizaos/plugin-bootstrap @elizaos/adapter-sqlite better-sqlite3 dotenv
```

You'll also want to make sure you're the correct version of node (v23.3.0). For example, you can use
either `nvm` or `pnpm` to set it up:

```bash tab="nvm"
nvm install 23.3.0
nvm use 23.3.0
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm env use --global 23.3.0
```

Make sure you've also installed the [Recall S3 adapter](/tools/s3) binary wherever you want to run
the Eliza agent.

</Step>

<Step>

## Setup

### Start the adapter

Then, start the Recall S3 adapter with the following command, replacing the values with your own:

```sh
recall_s3 \
--private-key [your_private_key] \
--access-key AKEXAMPLES3S \
--secret-key SKEXAMPLES3S
```

### Create a bucket

You'll need an existing bucket to use the GAME plugin. You can do this with an S3-compatible tool
(since we have the adapter running already), or use the [Recall CLI](/tools/cli) to create one. The
key callout is that you **must** set the `alias` metadata to `eliza-bucket` (or whatever bucket
alias you like):

```sh
recall bucket create --metadata 'alias=eliza-bucket'
```

### Create a `.env` file

Next, we'll copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

There are a few environment variables you'll need to set. You can choose your model provider (as
defined in your Eliza character file), but we'll use OpenAI for this example.

```bash
# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Recall S3 adapter
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKEXAMPLES3S
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=SKEXAMPLES3S
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_S3_BUCKET=eliza-bucket
AWS_S3_UPLOAD_PATH=logs/
AWS_S3_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8014
AWS_S3_SSL_ENABLED=false
AWS_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true
```

A few callouts:

- The `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `S3_ENDPOINT` should be the same as the ones
  you use to run the `recall_s3` binary.
- The `S3_BUCKET` is the aliased bucket name. Note that if the adapter is running with a private key
  that _is not_ the same as the creator of the bucket, you'll need to use the expanded format
  `<0x_wallet_address>.<bucket_name>`. The [bucket usage](/tools/s3#create-an-aliased-bucket) docs
  describe the format in more detail, but generally, you likely just use `game-bucket` as the value.
- The `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` should be set to `true` if you're using a local S3 adapter, which
  ensures the way objects are added or retrieved matches the adapter's expectation.
- Optionally, you can set the `AWS_S3_UPLOAD_PATH` to a custom object prefix.

</Step>

<Step>

## Create helper functions

### Set up database and cache

There are quite a few dependencies to import for the Eliza agent, so we'll start by setting up the
utility methods for database and caching, which are required for the agent to run.

```ts title="util.ts"
import { SqliteDatabaseAdapter } from "@elizaos/adapter-sqlite";
import { CacheManager, Character, DbCacheAdapter, IDatabaseCacheAdapter } from "@elizaos/core";
import Database from "better-sqlite3";
import { existsSync, mkdirSync } from "fs";
import path from "path";
```

Our helpers functions will use a SQLite database to store the agent's state, and a cache to store
the character's data. Later, we'll use the bootstrap plugin to create the tables in our database
automatically, which is necessary to store agent memories and state.

```ts title="util.ts"
export function initializeDatabase(dataDir: string = "./data") {
  if (!existsSync(dataDir)) {
    mkdirSync(dataDir, { recursive: true });
  }

  const filePath = path.resolve(dataDir, "db.sqlite");
  const db = new SqliteDatabaseAdapter(new Database(filePath));
  return db;
}

export function initializeDbCache(character: Character, db: IDatabaseCacheAdapter) {
  const cache = new CacheManager(new DbCacheAdapter(db, character.id));
  return cache;
}
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Set up the character

First, we'll get our imports set up:

```ts title="index.ts"
import { DirectClient } from "@elizaos/client-direct";
import {
  AgentRuntime,
  type Character,
  ModelProviderName,
  ServiceType,
  defaultCharacter,
  elizaLogger,
} from "@elizaos/core";
import { bootstrapPlugin } from "@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap";
import { type AwsS3Service, createNodePlugin } from "@elizaos/plugin-node";
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";

import { initializeDatabase, initializeDbCache } from "./util.js";

dotenv.config();
```

Next, we'll need to set up a character file. Eliza has many built-in character examples, and they
also expose a default character that you can override.

<Callout type="info">

When we initialize the character, we'll override the model provider to use OpenAI, and set the
`secrets` to use the environment variables we set up earlier. These are required for the S3 plugin
to work. Also, if you don't set a model provider, it _might_ default to a downloaded model...which
can be quite large.

</Callout>

```ts title="index.ts"
// Load environment variables
const {
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
  AWS_REGION,
  AWS_S3_BUCKET,
  AWS_S3_UPLOAD_PATH,
  AWS_S3_ENDPOINT,
  AWS_S3_SSL_ENABLED,
  AWS_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE,
  OPENAI_API_KEY,
} = process.env;

// Create a character with the default settings and overrides
const character = {
  ...defaultCharacter,
  modelProvider: ModelProviderName.OPENAI,
  settings: {
    secrets: {
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
      AWS_REGION,
      AWS_S3_BUCKET,
      AWS_S3_UPLOAD_PATH,
      AWS_S3_ENDPOINT,
      AWS_S3_SSL_ENABLED,
      AWS_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE,
    },
  },
};
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Configure the agent

Now, we'll create a client to interact with the agent. We'll need the node plugin (for the S3
functionality), database, and cache.

```ts title="index.ts"
async function main() {
  const client = new DirectClient();
  const nodePlugin = createNodePlugin();

  const db = initializeDatabase();
  await db.init();

  const cache = initializeDbCache(character, db);
}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

Then, we need to create the agent runtime, passing the values we set up earlier, and then register
the agent with the client.

```ts title="index.ts"
async function main() {
  // Existing code...

  const runtime = new AgentRuntime({
    character,
    token: OPENAI_API_KEY,
    modelProvider: ModelProviderName.OPENAI,
    databaseAdapter: db,
    cacheManager: cache,
    plugins: [bootstrapPlugin, nodePlugin],
  });

  await runtime.initialize();
  client.registerAgent(runtime);
}
```

Lastly, we'll need to create a function to run the agent. Here, we'll insert a simple example of
writing a hardcoded object to the S3 adapter.

```ts title="index.ts"
async function main() {
  // Existing code...

  const awsS3Service: AwsS3Service = runtime.getService(ServiceType.AWS_S3);
  const json = { hello: "world" };
  const key = "hello/world";
  const prefix = ""; // We already set the prefix in the environment variables
  const useSignedUrl = true;
  const ttl = 3600; // 1 hour
  const result = await awsS3Service.uploadJson(json, key, prefix, useSignedUrl, ttl);
  elizaLogger.info(result);

  client.start(); // Default port is 3000
  elizaLogger.info(`Started ${character.name} as ${runtime.agentId}`);
}
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Run the agent

Now, we can finally run the agent by calling the `main` function! Depending on your setup, you may
need to run the agent with something like `ts-node` or `tsx`, e.g., `npx tsx index.ts`.

This will log the configured agent information, and the we'll see our object uploaded to the S3
adapter. Afterwards, the client will start and be available for API requests.

[2025-02-10 04:34:21] INFO: Started Eliza as b850bc30-45f8-0041-a00a-83df46d8555d
```

We can then use the Recall CLI or other S3-compatible tool to view the object in our bucket! Lastly,
if you want to interact with the agent, the direct client we started is running on port 3000 (by
default).

For example, we can send a simple message to the uuid of the agent (logged above as
`b850bc30-45f8-0041-a00a-83df46d8555d`):

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/b850bc30-45f8-0041-a00a-83df46d8555d/message \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "text": "hi there",
  "userId": "user123",
  "userName": "dtb",
  "roomId": "room123"
}'
```

And the model will respond with something like:

```sh
[
  {
    "user": "Eliza",
    "text": "back again, i see. tell me, are we on a quest to decode the mysteries of Recall today, or is there another digital adventure on the horizon?",
    "action": "NONE"
  }
]
```

Although interacting with these APIs does not explicitly use our bucket upload logic, it'd be
straightforward to enhance this setup to persist agent state or relevant interactions (e.g.,
user-provided files) within Recall.
