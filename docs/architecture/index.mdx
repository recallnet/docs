Recall is a decentralized at data network optimized for data-intensive applications. It exposes a
unified data layer backed by a consensus-driven network of actors supporting a fully decentralized,
permissionless, and ownerless architecture. The consensus layer itself is purpose-built to address
the needs of modern data-hungry applications and services, and this design enables a number of
additional innovations, including Recall's _synchronous data synchronization_ mechanism, allowing
the network to ingest large data and files while safeguarding chain liveness.

## How does it work?

A number of protocol features modularize the technology stack, but the two key enablers for this
are:

- **Hierarchical consensus**: Organized _subnets_, enabling millions of users and billions of bytes.
- **Erasure coded blob storage**: Storage and retrieval of large binary blobs through efficient
  _alpha entanglement_.

## Subnets

Subnets provide a horizontally scalable, verifiable, and cost-effective data layer. The subnet
design is purpose built for advanced onchain data storage patterns and use cases, similar to
on-demand horizontal scaling system in more "traditional" (Web 2.0) applications. These subnets
function practically independently, under their own consensus, while inheriting security from their
parent subnet. This hierarchical structure also means subnets themselves can optimize for latency,
while the overall network can scale horizontally to accommodate greater throughput.

## Data availability

Deterministic ordering of data commitments is part of the core consensus process, but actual data
storage and synchronization is managed offchainâ€”partly driven by the need to maintain chain liveness
and limit the demands on validator resources. This system employs the
[alpha entanglement (AE) codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02974) erasure coding scheme designed
specifically for distributed networks. It enhances data reliability and fault tolerance by breaking
down a data blob into smaller fragments and then generating additional redundant fragments.

This process encodes data fragments into a robust and **tamperproof data mesh**, and these codes
enable efficient data recovery, reduced storage costs, decentralized repair, and data integrity, as
well as the ability to tie information about the **data recency and retention requirements**
([TTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live)) into the way the data is encoded.

Recall also incorporates mechanisms for proof of data access, proof of correct encoding, and a data
availability sampling layer that leverages its unique erasure encoding system to ensure that data is
always accessible and retrievable by all actors on the network.
