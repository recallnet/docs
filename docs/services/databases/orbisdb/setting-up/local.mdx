description: Learn how to set up OrbisDB locally.

Like in most cases, a local environment is usually the best start. It makes exploring and playing
around with different setups easier.

## Video tutorial

To make things easier, we've prepared a short YouTube step-by-step guide.

## Requirements

In order to run OrbisDB you need to set up 3 main components:

- Ceramic Node
- PostgreSQL
- OrbisDB Node

If you want to know the role of each component, check out our
[architecture overview](/databases/orbisdb-introduction/architecture).

<Steps>

<Step>

### NodeJS

OrbisDB and Ceramic utilize NodeJS and its native package manager. You need to have them installed
before continuing. You can do so using one of the
[package managers](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) or running a
[NodeJS installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer).

Alternatively, if you need to manage multiple NodeJS versions due to your other projects, NVM (_Node
Version Manager_) is recommended ([MacOS](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm),
[Linux](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), [Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)).

</Step>

<Step>

### Ceramic

Since OrbisDB is built on top of Ceramic's event protocol, it makes sense to start by setting up
your Ceramic Node.

> Ceramic **does not officially support Windows**. You follow the setup using
> [Windows WSL](https://canonical-ubuntu-wsl.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/guides/install-ubuntu-wsl2/).
> Alternatively, you can use a [Managed Ceramic Node](/databases/orbisdb-setting-up/managed-studio)
> or check out [Orbis Studio](/databases/orbisdb-setting-up/managed-studio) for a fully managed
> experience powered by Orbis.

You can check out Ceramic's official
[quickstart](https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/guides/ceramic-nodes/running-locally).

#### Installing Ceramic

To get the required package installed, run the following in your Terminal

```bash
npm install -g @ceramicnetwork/cli
```

This command utilizes NPM (Node Package Manager) which is installed alongside NodeJS. The command
installs Ceramic's software globally.

#### Running Ceramic

After installing Ceramic using the above command, you're able to run Ceramic by pasting the
following in your Terminal

```bash
ceramic daemon
```

This command will run a Ceramic Node locally, exposed locally on port `7007`. The Node will be
connected to **Ceramic's Testnet**. To verify that the Ceramic Node is running, visit
`http://localhost:7007/api/v0/node/healthcheck`. The text should say `Alive!`.

</Step>

<Step>

### PostgreSQL

OrbisDB's indexing is backed by PostgreSQL - the most popular open-source database. You can install
PostgreSQL by using the
[appropriate installer](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads) for
your OS. Here's some tutorials to make the process even easier to understand -
[MacOS](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/install-postgresql-macos/),
[Linux](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/install-postgresql-linux/),
[Windows](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/install-postgresql/).

Alternatively, you can start with a free managed PostgreSQL database, such as
[Supabase](https://supabase.com/), [Neon](https://neon.tech/) or [Fly.io](https://fly.io/).

</Step>

<Step>

### OrbisDB

To run the actual OrbisDB Node, you need to download it from our
[Github](https://github.com/OrbisWeb3/orbisdb). You can do so by using Git or by downloading the
repository as a ZIP file.

#### Download using Git

If you have [Git installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads), you can run the following in your
Terminal

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OrbisWeb3/orbisdb.git
```

This will download (clone) the entire OrbisDB repository into a folder named `orbisdb`. The location
of the folder will depend on the place you ran the command from.

#### Downloading as a .zip

You can download the OrbisDB repository as a .zip file by
[clicking here](https://github.com/OrbisWeb3/orbisdb/archive/refs/heads/master.zip). Once
downloaded, you can extract and move the folder to your liking - just remember where it is.

#### Installing dependencies

OrbisDB, like Ceramic, is powered by NodeJS. It requires a couple of 3rd party packages to get
running. To do so, open your Terminal in the folder you placed OrbisDB and run the following

```bash
npm install
```

This command will install all _required_ packages to get the OrbisDB Node running

#### Running OrbisDB

Finally, open up your Terminal in the folder you placed OrbisDB files into (the same one you ran the
above command from) and run the following

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will spin up an OrbisDB Node on locally on port `7008`. If everything went well, you
should be able to navigate to the OrbisDB UI by visiting `http://localhost:7008`.

#### Configuring the Node

Once running, our OrbisDB UI Wizard will guide you through the process. For a bit more help, check
out our [Dashboard Setting up](/databases/orbisdb-dashboard-reference) guide.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Summary

To run OrbisDB you need to do the following

1. Install [NodeJS 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer)+
2. Install and run
   [Ceramic](https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/guides/ceramic-nodes/running-locally)
3. Install and run
   [PostgreSQL](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads)
4. Download, install and run [OrbisDB](https://github.com/OrbisWeb3/orbisdb)

Finally, with everything completed, you should be able to navigate to the OrbisDB UI by visiting
`http://localhost:7008`.

## Docker **`Coming soon`**

We are working on Docker images to simplify the setup process with prebuilt binaries and bundled
options.

## Alternatives to running locally

If you feel a bit overwhelmed by the steps, you can try exploring OrbisDB via
[OrbisDB Studio](/databases/orbisdb-setting-up/managed-studio), our free shared instance that's
ready to go - no setup required. If you still want to have a dedicated instance, but don't want to
go through all the trouble of setting it up, you should check out our Managed section.
