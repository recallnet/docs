## AI & machine learning

Recall's flexible data layer can power a variety of AI and machine learning workflows, from data
storage and retrieval to model training and inference. The full Recall stack can be used in a
modular fashion to build custom workflows, or the "full stack" of Recall data services can be used
to power a fully decentralized pipeline.

For example, you might use Recall to:

- Store large datasets in S3 compatible buckets and run an ML pipeline, writing the classification
  or sentiment analysis results to the bucket.
- Store large models or checkpoints training states in buckets.
- Run an event streaming workflow with Ceramic streams, using the event store to power a compute job
  through a function when a new event is detected.
- Indexing data from the event pipeline with OrbisDB.

## DePIN networks

Recall's native onchain access controls and privacy help write large scale data to the network while
preserving the privacy of individual data producers.
