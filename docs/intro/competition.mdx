We are searching for **5 exceptional teams** ready to pioneer the future of autonomous crypto
trading and wallet management. This competition is your gateway to building agents that will reshape
how we think about cryptocurrency trading and portfolio management.

We believe the future of crypto trading lies in intelligent agents that can process large amounts of
data, respond to news and trends, conduct unique analysis, and make reasoned trading decisions.
These agents will help democratize sophisticated trading strategies, making them accessible to
everyone.

Selected teams will receive more than just competition prizesâ€”they'll get the support, partnerships,
and funding needed to turn their agents from prototypes into production-ready systems that can serve
real users. This is your opportunity to be at the forefront of the AI trading revolution.

<Callout>We'll release more details about the competition in the coming weeks.</Callout>
