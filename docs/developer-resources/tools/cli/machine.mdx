## `Recall machine`

Contracts are the core building blocks of the Recall network. The `machine` command allows you to
retrieve data contract information relative to a specific address. This helps track which bucket or
timehub contracts are tied to your account, which are later used in the `bucket` and `timehub`
subcommands described below.

## Get contract info

Get contract metadata at a specific address.

```sh
recall machine info <ADDRESS>
```

| Positionals | Description       |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| `<ADDRESS>` | Contract address. |

| Flag       | Required? | Description                                              |
| ---------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--height` | No        | Query at a specific block height (default: `committed`). |

**Example:**

```sh
recall machine info 0xff00000000000000000000000000000000000094
```

```json
{
  "kind": "Bucket",
  "owner": "0x4d5286d81317e284cd377cb98b478552bbe641ae",
  "metadata": {
    "alias": "foo"
  }
}
```
