GAME is a modular agentic framework engine that enables agents to plan and make decisions
autonomously, built by [Virtuals](https://virtuals.io/). It comes with a standard set of plugins and
tools to get you started, and Recall is in the process of adding a Recall-native plugin, too.

## Recall plugins

The following are available for use with the GAME framework:

<Cards>
  <Card

    description="Easy drop in for S3-compatible storage with the GAME framework."
    href="/agents/plugins/game/s3"
  />
  <Card
    title="CoT logs"
    description="Store GAME Terminal API logs and reasoning (note: not live yet, coming soon!)"
    className="hover:cursor-not-allowed"
  />
</Cards>

## Get a GAME API key

An API key is required to use the GAME framework, which you can get from the GAME console:
[https://console.game.virtuals.io](https://console.game.virtuals.io).

## Next steps

Once you're set up, can store or read arbitrary data with the S3 plugin, and store or read CoT logs
with the CoT plugin.
