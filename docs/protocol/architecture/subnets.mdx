## Hierarchical subnets

Most blockchain scaling solutions either inherit L1 security without their own consensus algorithms
(e.g., rollups) or have their own consensus but lack L1 security (e.g., sidechains). In contrast,
the [hierarchical subnet](https://docs.ipc.space/overview/how-ipc-compares) strategy employed by
Recall operates as a hybrid of these approaches, allowing subnets to have their own consensus
algorithms while also inheriting security from parent subnets. This hierarchical structure also
means subnets themselves can optimize for reducing _latency_, while the overall network can scale
horizontally to accommodate greater _throughput_.

## State replication

Subnets provide _semantic isolation_, allowing for the creation of specialized subnets tailored to
specific use cases. Examples include subnets defined by geographic region(s), service-level
agreements (SLA), feature sets, public/private, encryption, or even targeted data types and use
cases (e.g., AI, ML, or private app data).

Recall's _core_ is a deterministic state machine that interfaces with the consensus engine, which in
turn ensures the blockchain's state is consistently replicated across each subnet. At a high level,
Recall combines onchain _contracts_, offchain _services_, and async computation through _functions_.
Its [EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) compatibility ensures that it can integrate
smoothly with existing Ethereum tooling, while its native support for _asynchronous compute_ makes
it uniquely suited to data-intensive applications.
