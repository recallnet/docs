This page outlines best practices for contributing to the Hoku docs or the codebase. If you're looking to contribute to
source code, check out our GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/hokunetwork). For docs contributions, this site
is built with [Nextra](https://nextra.site/docs) and uses many of its built-in features, some of which are described
below.

## Prose & best practices

- Use sentence case for headings (e.g., `This is a heading` vs. `This Is A Heading`).
- Use single word `onchain` and `offchain` instead of the hyphenated `on-chain` and `off-chain`.
- Internal pages should use an absolute link instead of relative (it makes it easier to reorganize content).

## Frontmatter

Frontmatter is used to set the title and description for the page upon rendering and should be at the top of the file in
the format below. The `title` and `description` **must** exist for every page; `keywords` are optional and used in SEO.

```mdx
---
title: Title here
description: Description here
keywords: keyword1, keyword2, keyword3
---
```

## Headings

Use `##` (or lower) for headings, and do not use a single `#` for the top-level heading since it's reserved for the page
title, which gets rendered from what's defined in the frontmatter's `title`.

## Code blocks

Code blocks can take a language, line highlighting, click-to-copy functionality, and filenames. The example below will
highlight lines 1 and 3, include a name for the file, and make sure the snippet is copyable:

````mdx copy
```txt {1,3} filename="hello.txt" copy
hello my
name
is Hoku
```
````

```txt {1,3} filename="hello.txt" copy
hello my
name
is Hoku
```

A regex can be used to highlight specific sections and could use `{/hello my/}` to replace the `{1,3}` and only
highlight the relevant parts from line 1.

```txt {/hello my/} filename="hello.txt" copy
hello my
name
is Hoku
```

## Sidebars

To adjust the sidebar, each folder has a `_meta.json` file with follows the
[Nextra convention](https://nextra.site/docs/docs-theme/page-configuration) with a couple of tweaks. The "root" and
"nested" sidebar files differ slightly, and the root page shouldn't require much adjusting since these are "core" pages
that won't change often. The general structure defines navbar elements and any non-nested pages that should appear on
the docs landing page.

```json filename="pages/_meta.json"
{
  "*": {
    "type": "page",
    "display": "hidden"
  },
  "nav-page": {
    "title": "My nested folder",
    "type": "menu",
    "display": "normal",
    "items": {
      "nested": {
        "title": "My nested page",
        "href": "/nested"
      }
    }
  },
  "introduction": "Introduction"
}
```

For the nested page, it should have a `<-` key, which maps to the root `/home` page link, and then it should have the
overall nested sidebar page title. The remaining

```json filename="pages/nested/_meta.json"
{
  "<-": { "title": "Back to home", "href": "/home" },
  "-": { "title": "My nested page", "type": "separator" },
  "index": "Overview"
}
```

## Cards

`<Cards>` are useful for links that guide the user to primary resources. Use a `<Cards>` with nested `<Card>`
components:

```mdx
<Cards>

<Card title="My card" href="/" />

</Cards>
```

<Cards>

<Card title="My card" href="/" />

</Cards>

## Callouts

A `<Callout>` can be used to draw attention to important information. Four types are possible: `default`, `info`,
`warning`, or `error`.

```mdx
<Callout type="default">

Some info.

</Callout>
```

<Callout type="default">

Some info.

</Callout>

## Steps

Steps are useful for guides—and be sure to space them properly and use the correct headings to avoid rendering issues!
Use a `<Steps>` with nested `###` (h3) and place the content below the heading:

<Steps>

### Step 1

This is a step

</Steps>

## Folder structure

Use the `FileTree` component to display a folder structure, which lets you render nested folders and files:

```
<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="my-folder" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="my-file.json" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="nested">
      <FileTree.File name="other-file.json" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>
```

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="my-folder" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="my-file.json" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="nested" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="other-file.json" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

## Package install tab

For JavaScript package installation instructions, use the `npm2yarn` code block annotation with the package name as the
content. This will add tabs for `npm`, `yarn`, etc.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i my-package
```

## Tabs

Similarly, `Tabs` can be created for custom tabs to display `items` and their respective content.

```mdx
<Tabs items={["JavaScript", "Rust"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>Javascript is cool</Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>Rust is fast</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>
```

<Tabs items={["JavaScript", "Rust"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>Javascript is cool</Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>Rust is fast</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Images

You can use the Next `Image` component to display images, or use the standard markdown syntax for images. This presumes
the path is under the `public` directory, but relative paths are also supported.

```
import Image from 'next/image'

<Image src="/img/textile-logo.png" alt="Textile" width={100} height={100} />

![Hello](/img/textile-logo.png)
```

<Image src="/img/textile-logo.png" alt="Textile" width={100} height={100} />

## Math

Math is supported with a codeblock that has `math` as the language—e.g., `c = \pm\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}`:

```math
c = \pm\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
```
