## Privileged roles in Recall network

The RECALL token deployments include some "privileged" roles that give certain addresses the ability
to perform specific administrative functions. These roles are secured by multisig wallets to
minimize associated risks.

### Recall security council

The Recall Security Council is responsible for pausing token operations in emergency situations.

### Recall foundation

The Recall Foundation manages contract upgrades and token minting.
