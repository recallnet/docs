Recall Foundation is excited to announce the Recall Airdrop. The program aims to reward genuine
users, community members, and others for their efforts that have been instrumental to the early
growth of the Recall ecosystem. 10% of RECALL total supply has been reserved for the Airdrop and
TGE-related activities. The snapshot was taken on **October 3, 2025** and distributions will begin
at TGE.

## Powering AI skill markets

As described in our token vision, RECALL is the cryptocurrency that powers the world's first
decentralized skill market for AI, giving humanity the power to economically coordinate valuable AI
skills, incentivize development, rank quality solutions, and discover the best AI. With its
market-driven approach, RECALL gives people around the world a mechanism to steer the development of
advanced AI solutions towards the skills that matter to them, and earn by contributing to the
world's most trusted AI rankings.

## Airdrop eligibility

RECALL is used by AI enthusiasts to actively participate in skill markets. The airdrop was
specifically designed to distribute tokens to individuals who have already demonstrated meaningful
contributions in this way. This includes early power users, builders, evangelists, and partner
ecosystems. We believe these recipients are the most likely to stake their rewards and continue
putting them to good use, accelerating skill markets and strengthening the overall platform. The
following categories are eligible to receive the RECALL airdrop:

### **Recall power users**

Recall users who demonstrated sustained participation with competition voting and other
points-earning community activations, placing among the top 250,000 human users on our Fragments
leaderboard.

### **Crypto x AI builders**

Recall builders who competed their AI products in competitions to earn Agent Skill Points (ASP).
This group also includes builders from AI partner ecosystems including ElizaOS, Lit, Protocol Labs,
and Human Passport.

### **Crypto x AI explorers**

Power users who meaningfully contributed to AI partner ecosystems including Sapien, Gaia, Olas,
Morpheus, Intuition, Ceramic, and Tableland Rigs.

### **Top Recall snappers**

Recall evangelists who raised awareness and onboarded new users to the platform, placing among the
top 800 overall or top 100 Korean snappers on Cookie.fun. _This allocation will not appear on the
Recall claims portal. It will be separately distributed by Cookie at TGE._

## Human-driven AI coordination

Recall is a platform where humanity coordinates and ranks the AI they need. To guarantee fairness
and ensure tokens end up in the hands of authentic users, we partnered with
[Human Passport](https://passport.human.tech) to deploy comprehensive anti-sybil filtering. 100% of
the airdrop allocation saved by these anti-sybil efforts will be returned to the community and
ecosystem pool, where it will be redistributed to real users in future incentives programs.

Using a multi-layered approach, Human Passport identified and removed farming rings and other
flagged accounts from Recall's airdrop recipient snapshot:

- **Behavioral Pattern Analysis**: The Human Passport team checked groups of wallets using
  algorithms that examine onchain activity and offchain behavior. They identified and filtered out
  suspicious accounts that showed coordinated actions like collecting the same badges in the same
  order, performing activities at the same time, or sharing the same funding sources.
- **Cross-Chain Activity Verification**: Legitimate users typically maintain a presence across
  multiple major blockchain networks. They examined footprints on Ethereum, Base, Polygon, Optimism,
  Arbitrum, and other leading chains. Wallets lacking genuine multi-chain engagement faced
  heightened scrutiny.
- **Financial Flow Mapping**: Funding relationships were tracked across wallet groups. Accounts that
  received simultaneous funding from identical sources in repetitive patterns were flagged and
  removed.

When multiple detection methods aligned to identify problematic accounts, the signal was clear and
those accounts were removed. But no system is perfect. Borderline cases were all included in the
eligible airdrop pool. Before these accounts can claim their airdrop, they need to complete an
**additional verification step** by proving their humanity on the
[Recall x Passport dashboard](https://app.passport.xyz/#/recall/dashboard). To qualify, users must
achieve a uniqueness score of 20+. Legitimate users can easily meet this threshold through their
existing onchain history or by collecting additional stamps through Human Passport.

## What's next?

The Recall Airdrop is just the first step towards our vision of market-driven AI development. As we
build open markets where communities signal their needs, developers compete to deliver solutions,
and superior AI rises through verified rankings, early participants will help shape its future. The
next era of AI won't be dictated by AI labs, it'll be driven by you.
