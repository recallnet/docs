The `basin_s3` binary is a simple adapter that allows you to use the Recall object storage system
with S3 APIs. Let's walk through how to set it up, and subsequent pages walk through how to use it
with ancillary tools like MinIO.

### Setup

<Steps>

<Step>

### Install

First, clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/recallnet/basin-s3
```

Then, `cd` into `basin-s3` and install the adapter binary:

```sh
make install
```

This should make `basin_s3` available in your path, which you can verify with `basin_s3 --version`.
Alternatively, if you don't want to install it, you can run it directly with `cargo run` in the
subsequent step.

</Step>

<Step>

### Run the adapter

Starting the Basin S3 adapter uses port `8014` by default. There are three required flags:

- `--private-key`: Hex encoded, Ethereum-style private key (ECDSA, secp256k1) for sending
  transactions (environment variable: `PRIVATE_KEY`).
- `--network`: The network to connect to (environment variable: `NETWORK`).
- `--access-key`: An S3 access key (e.g,. `AKEXAMPLES3S`)
- `--secret-key`: An S3 secret key (e.g., `SKEXAMPLES3S`)

```sh
basin_s3 --private-key [your_private_key] --access-key AKEXAMPLES3S --secret-key SKEXAMPLES3S
```

The access key and secret aren't used for anything other than matching the MinIO client
configuration. If you want to do read-only queries, simply omit the private key.

If you didn't install the binary in the previous step, you can run it directly with
`cargo run --features binary -- ...` and the arguments above.

If you do not already have a private key, you can generate one with the Recall CLI. You also _must_
make sure your account exists on the subnet, which requires you have deposited funds into your
subnet account. Neglecting this step will lead to errors like
`failed to init sequence; actor ... cannot be found`.

### Create an aliased bucket

Bucket usage slightly deviates from how you typically would in S3. This happens due to how the S3
adapter works alongside Basin by using aliases stored in metadata to help identify the bucket name
and its relationship with onchain buckets owned by the creator. To interact with any bucket, the
name you define is always prefixed by the creator's public key (i.e., EVM hex address), delimited by
a period.

The general format is `<0x_address>.<bucket_name>`. For example, if you create a bucket called
`my-store` with the private key `0x...`, the actual bucket name will be
`0x90f79bf6eb2c4f870365e785982e1f101e93b906.my-store`. Subsequent examples will describe this in
more detail with respect to the client that is used.

<Callout type="warning">

The S3 API prohibits bucket names from being longer than 63 characters: here. Since a hex address is
42 characters, it leaves 20 characters for the _actual_ bucket name (since bucket "names" are
`<hex_address>.<name>` with a period in between).

</Steps>

## Next steps

You can now use Basin with any S3-compatible tooling! There are a few walkthroughs that show how to
use it with ancillary tools like MinIO and Python `boto3`.
