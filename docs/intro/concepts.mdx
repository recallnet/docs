## Memory & knowledge blockchain

Recall puts agent data like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logs and decision making onchain, while also
connecting agents to _other_ agents or datasets to learn from. It offers features that put it in a
unique category compared to other blockchain or agent networks, including:

- **Lightening-fast settlement & consensus**: Hierarchical subnet architecture and layered consensus
  model that enables scalable, cost-effective storage and compute.
- **Native data availability**: Custom built for use cases revolving around storing and managing
  agentic and large scale data with high throughput in a decentralized fashion.
- **Network-level access control**: Sophisticated access control mechanisms for flexible
  monetization and data collaboration patterns.
- **Programmable execution**: Polyglot virtual machine (VM) used to execute onchain data logic in
  both EVM and Wasm execution runtimes with smart contracts.

The novel data availability mechanism makes it possible to store large volumes of heterogenous data,
and the protocol consists of a few different layers to facilitate different ways to manage agent
data.

## Buckets & blobs

The core data storage primitive is a _bucket_, which is a key-value store for arbitrary data is
represented as a _blob_. You can think of the agent's external "brain" as being a bucket with
accompanying features to improve its overall intelligence. Optionally, you can also define a
time-to-live (TTL) for the data, which is the amount of time the data will be stored before
expiring.

## Cognitive APIs

Recall SDKs, APIs, and framework plugins make it easy for any agent to have their own, dedicated
bucket that acts as a home for their data. For example, CoT logs, historical decisions, Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) documents, model generated data (like images or videos), or anything
relevant to the agent's decision making.

Developers can create agents with whatever framework they want. Recall is designed to be pluggable
so that you can drop it into your existing workflows and gain visibility into the agent's decision
making process. Since all data is stored onchain, it provides a view into your—or other—agents'
knowledge and memory, making it possible to inspect the agent's reasoning and share knowledge with
others.

## Contracts

_Contracts_ are arbitrary programs that run on the network, written for either EVM (Solidity) or
Wasm (Rust, etc.) execution. They provide the interface for reading and writing data, giving agents
a way to permissionlessly create, manage, and share their knowledge.

## Accounts

Like any blockchain system, _accounts_ are used to interact with the network. All transactions are
signed by an EVM-style key pair (ECDSA, secp256k1) to ensure that the transaction is authentic,
authorized, and verifiable. Accounts pay for network operations.

## Gas

Gas is used to pay for network usage. For example, when you create a bucket or send transactions,
you pay gas fees. However, when you _store_ data on the network, you pay in credits, which are a
unit of resource to perform a set of operations.

## Credit

Recall employs a novel _credit_ system to support usage-based pricing and predictable costs. For
example, storing an arbitrary blob for a defined amount of time costs a forecastable number of
credits, measured by the size of the data, the duration of the storage, and the computational
complexity of data processing.

## Virtual gas

Buying credits ensures users can pre-buy storage to that can be drawn down at a predictable rate.
_Virtual gas_ is the counterpart to this equation, also known as an account's _gas allowance_,
equivalent to the gas used to purchase credits. When you pay for gas operations, it either draws
down from your virtual gas balance, or uses your actual gas balance if there is no gas allowance
available.

## Operator approvals

Access to writing data is managed by _credit approvals_ and _sponsors_ (account operators). An
account that owns credit can authorize other accounts to use and draw down from its balance, and an
approved account can set its default sponsor to authorizing operator. This allows you to set up
multi-tiered collaboration and access control patterns.

## Functions

At its core, _functions_ are fundamental building blocks for task execution on the network. These
are implemented with Wasm-defined logic and can be thought of as a single, atomic unit of work that
can be executed onchain.

The core data storage primitive is a _blob_ function, which tracks opcode usage and reports gas
spend for tasks such as downloading input data, erasure coding outputs for blob storage, and more.

All subsequent layers are built on top of functions. Currently, the only function available is the
blob, but others will be added in the future (e.g., compute for performing transformations).

## Limits

There are a few constraints to be aware of when building on Recall:

- **Block time**: ~1 block per second.
- **Maximum object (blob) size**: 5 GiB.
