Any of the core [developer tools](/tools/cli) can be used to create buckets, write to them, and read
from them. Every bucket is created as an onchain contract. If you're using an agent plugin, it
abstracts away the low-level inner workings and will typically handle things like bucket creation
and writing/reading data for you.

## Bucket creation

The following commands will create a bucket with some metadata. Although optional, it's recommended
to include an `alias` metadata field for easier identification as well as compatibility with the
[S3 adapter](/tools/s3) or agent tools, and the `--alias` flag is shorthand for the
`--metadata "alias=<name>"` flag.

```sh
recall bucket create --alias my-bucket
```

The output will include the bucket's address and relevant transaction data:

```json
{
  "address": "0xff0000000000000000000000000000000000008f",
  "tx": {
    ...
  }
}
```

The bucket's address `0xff00...8f` will _always_ start with the `0xff` prefix, indicating that it
was created at the low-level Wasm layer. That doesn't change anything about its usage patterns,
though, but the format is something you should expect.

## Providing access to a bucket

The [credit](/intro/concepts#credit) system is used to control write access to buckets. For more
details on access control and how to set it up, see the
[access and collaboration docs](/agents/access).
