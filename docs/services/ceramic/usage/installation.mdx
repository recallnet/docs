description: Getting started with the Ceramic SDK.
---

The [Ceramic SDK](https://github.com/ceramicstudio/ceramic-sdk) enables user to interact with the
Ceramic's primitive APIs for creating streams as well as producing events on streams, consuming
events from streams, and aggregating stream state. Find it on GitHub at
https://github.com/ceramicstudio/ceramic-sdk.

The SDK is written in TypeScript and published to NPM as `@ceramic-sdk`, with a handful of useful
sub-packages:

- `@ceramic-sdk/events`: Utilities for creating and signing events that comply to the
  [Recall Event Store standards.](https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/streams/event-log)
- `@ceramic-sdk/http-client`: A simple client for
  [ceramic-one's](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic) HTTP APIs.
- `@ceramic-sdk/identifiers`: A handful of useful types for identifying streams and events.
- `@ceramic-sdk/model-client`: A client that handles the creation and fetching of model stream
  types.
- `@ceramic-sdk/model-instance-client`: A client that handles the creation and fetching of model
  instance document stream types.

<Callout>
  While Ceramic will eventually support a wide array of different stream types, this guide will
  focus on the use of models and model instance documents given they represent the predominant
  pattern developers currently use when interacting with the network.

The Ceramic SDK needs a [ceramic-one](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic) daemon to
connect to.

Let's get them all installed!

<Steps>

<Step>

### Install ceramic-one

ceramic-one can run on macOS, Linux, or from within a docker container.

#### MacOS

Install from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install ceramicnetwork/tap/ceramic-one
```

#### Linux (Debian-based distributions)

Install a the latest release using dpkg:

```bash
# get deb.tar.gz
curl -LO https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic/releases/download/latest/ceramic-one_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
# untar the Debian software package file
tar zxvf ceramic-one_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
# install with dpkg - package manager for Debian
dpkg -i ceramic-one.deb
```

#### Linux (from Source)

```bash
# Install rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
# Install build tools
apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config openssl libssl-dev unzip
# Update environment
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
# Install protobuf
PROTOC_VERSION=3.20.1
PROTOC_ZIP=protoc-$PROTOC_VERSION-linux-x86_64.zip
curl --retry 3 --retry-max-time 90 -OL https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v$PROTOC_VERSION/$PROTOC_ZIP \
    && unzip -o $PROTOC_ZIP -d /usr/local bin/protoc \
    && unzip -o $PROTOC_ZIP -d /usr/local 'include/*' \
    && rm -f $PROTOC_ZIP
# Checkout rust-ceramic repo
git clone https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic
# Enter repo and build
cd rust-ceramic
make build
cp ./target/release/ceramic-one /usr/local/bin/ceramic-one
```

#### Docker

Start rust-ceramic using the host network:

```bash
docker run --network=host \
  public.ecr.aws/r5b3e0r5/3box/ceramic-one:latest
```

#### Docker-Compose

1. Create a testing directory, and enter it:

```bash
mkdir ceramic-recon
cd ceramic-recon
```

2. Save the following docker-compose.yaml there:

```YAML
version: '3.8'

services:
  ceramic-one:
    image: public.ecr.aws/r5b3e0r5/3box/ceramic-one:latest
    network_mode: "host"
    volumes:
      - ceramic-one-data:/root/.ceramic-one
volumes:
  ceramic-one-data:
    driver: local
```

3. Run `docker-compose up -d`

</Step>

<Step>

### Run the ceramic-one daemon

```bash
# if necessary, include the path/to/the/binary e.g. /usr/local/bin/ceramic-one or ./target/release/ceramic-one
$ ceramic-one daemon

# There are many flags for the daemon CLI that can be passed directly or set as environment variables.
# See `DaemonOpts` in one/src/lib.rs for the complete list or pass the -h flag
$ ceramic-one daemon -h

# A few common options are overriding the log level:
$ RUST_LOG=warn,ceramic_one=info,ceramic_service=debug ceramic-one daemon
# Or modifying the network
$ ceramic-one daemon --network testnet-clay
$ ceramic-one daemon --network local --local-network-id 0
# Or changing where directory where all data is stored. This folder SHOULD be backed up in production
# and if you change the defaults, you MUST specify it every time you start the daemon.
$ ceramic-one daemon --store-dir ./custom-store-dir
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Add client packages to your project

```bash
npm install --save @ceramic-sdk/events @ceramic-sdk/identifiers @ceramic-sdk/http-client
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Set up your client

```typescript
import { CeramicClient } from "@ceramic-sdk/http-client";

const client = new CeramicClient({ url: "http://localhost:5101" });

// Now some calls!
const response = await client.getVersion();

// Confirm it matches the version you just installed
console.log(response.version);
```

</Step>
