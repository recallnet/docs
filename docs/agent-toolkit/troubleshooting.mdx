## Common issues

### Authentication errors

#### Invalid Private Key Format

Ensure your private key is in the correct format. It should be a 64-character hexadecimal string,
optionally with a `0x` prefix.

```typescript
// Correct format
const privateKey = "0x1234..."; // With 0x prefix
// or
const privateKey = "1234...";   // Without 0x prefix (64 characters)
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Never hardcode private keys in production code. Use environment variables or secure key management
  solutions.
</Callout>

#### Network mismatch

Verify that you're connecting to the correct network. The network in your toolkit configuration
should match your intended environment.

```typescript
const toolkit = new RecallAgentToolkit({
  privateKey: process.env.RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY,
  configuration: {
    actions: {
      // Your actions config
    },
    context: {
      network: "testnet", // Make sure this matches your intended network
    },
  },
});
```

Currently supported networks are:

- `testnet` - The Recall testnet environment
- `localnet` - For local development

#### Insufficient funds

If transactions are failing, your account may have insufficient RECALL tokens or credit.

Check your balance using:

```typescript
const accountInfo = await toolkit.getTools().get_account_info();
console.log(accountInfo);
```

You can acquire testnet tokens through the Recall faucet or by purchasing credit through the
`buy_credit` tool.

### Permission errors

#### Missing permissions

If tools are unavailable or operations fail with permission errors, check that you've configured the
correct permissions.

```typescript
const toolkit = new RecallAgentToolkit({
  privateKey: process.env.RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY,
  configuration: {
    actions: {
      account: {
        read: true, // Required for get_account_info, get_credit_info
        write: true, // Required for buy_credit
      },
      bucket: {
        read: true, // Required for list_buckets, get_object, query_objects
        write: true, // Required for get_or_create_bucket, add_object
      },
    },
    // ...
  },
});
```

Ensure the permissions match your use case requirements.

### Bucket and object issues

#### Bucket creation failures

If bucket creation fails, check the following:

- You have sufficient credit in your account
- Your bucket name follows the required format (lowercase alphanumeric with optional hyphens)
- You don't already have a bucket with the same name

#### Object storage problems

When storing objects, ensure:

- The object contents are properly formatted (strings, JSON objects, etc.)
- Object metadata is valid JSON
- You have sufficient storage space and credit

#### Query syntax issues

If your object queries aren't returning expected results, verify your query syntax is correct. For
example, add query filters based on object metadata fields, not the content itself.

## Common error messages

| Error                  | Likely cause                        | Solution                                               |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Invalid private key    | Incorrectly formatted private key   | Ensure private key is a valid 64-character hex string  |
| Insufficient funds     | Account lacks RECALL tokens         | Use faucet or buy tokens                               |
| Bucket creation failed | Insufficient credit or invalid name | Check credit balance and bucket naming rules           |
| Permission issues      | Missing required permissions        | Update toolkit configuration with required permissions |
| Network error          | Connection issues                   | Check network settings and server status               |
