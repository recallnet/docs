title: Local development
description: Install prerequisites and build the Recall binaries.
---

For developers looking to test and develop locally, Recall offers a couple of specialized
development environments. This page outlines how to install the necessary dependencies that precede
building and installing the underlying Recall binaries required to run the network. If you already
have these installed on your machine, you can proceed to the [localnet](/protocol/local/localnet) or
[devnet](/protocol/local/devnet) pages.

## Background

There are two primary ways to use these scripts:

1. Run a local network with three nodes and Anvil as the root chain (`localnet`).
2. Run a local network without any root chain (`devnet`).

Option (1) leverages Dockerized instances of Iroh, Fendermint, CometBFT, and ancillary services. All
of this logic is located in the `scripts` directory. Option (2) requires you to have various
dependencies running directly on your host machine, so there's a bit of manual setup required.

## Installation

Clone the `ipc` repo and build the project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/recallnet/ipc
cd ipc
make
```

This will generate the `ipc-cli` and `fendermint` binaries in the `target/release/` directory.

## Usage

Regardless of the target development environment (`localnet` or `devnet`), there are a handful of
build dependencies you'll need to install on your machine to run the scripts.

### Build dependencies

You'll need the following dependencies installed on your machine:

- `rustup`
- `cargo make`
- `toml-cli`
- `foundry`
- `node`
- `docker`
- `jq`

If you run the localnet via the `make run-localnet` script, it _will_ check for the existence of
these dependencies. For Linux machines, the script _will also_ handle installation for all build
dependencies. For macOS, it _will not_ automatically install them. Instead, you'll have to do this
manually, but the script _will_ log and let you know what you're missing before proceeding. The
section below outlines how to do this for macOS.

#### Linux

The `make run-localnet` script will handle all the build dependencies for a Linux machine. Note this
is specific to the `localnet` environment, and not the `devnet` environment, but the dependencies
are generally the same.

#### MacOS

You'll need to install the following dependencies if they are not already available:

- Xcode from App Store or terminal: `xcode-select --install`
- Homebrew: Required for installing `jq` and possibly other dependencies. See the official Homebrew
  docs [here](https://brew.sh/) (but it's probably already installed).
- `docker`: Required to run the Dockerized nodes. See the official Docker docs
  [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install).
- `jq`: Needed for much of the JSON parsing logic when working with configuration files.

  ```shell
  brew install jq
  ```

- `rustup`: Required for building the Docker images (i.e., most of the stack is written in Rust).
  See the official Rust docs [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and make sure `cargo`
  gets installed.

  ```shell
  curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y
  ```

- `cargo make`: Required for building the Docker images.

  ```shell
  cargo install cargo-make
  ```

- `toml-cli`: Needed for reading and writing various configuration files used by Docker images.

  ```shell
  cargo install toml-cli
  ```

- `foundryup`: Used for various onchain operations. See the official Foundry docs
  [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) and make sure `cast` gets
  installed.

  ```shell
  curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
  foundryup
  ```

- Node.js: Needed for compiling and deploying contracts with Hardhat. See the official Node.js docs
  [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download)—or use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (described
  below for `bash` shells).

  ```shell
  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
  source "$HOME/.bashrc" # This step will vary by OS
  nvm install --default lts/*
  ```

### Environment variables

All logic handled in the `scripts/deploy_subnet/deploy.sh` script uses the following environment
variables, which are defined in the `env.example` file. For localnet deployments, you won't need to
set any of the above. There are also two additional optional variables:

- `SKIP_DEPENDENCIES`: Skips the installation of build dependencies.
- `SKIP_BUILD`: Skips the build step for the entire stack. You **MUST** run this at least once
  before starting the network. Notably, this also installs the `ipc-cli` binary that is used heavily
  during the deployment script. After doing so, future `deploy.sh` invocations will use the existing
  build artifacts, so you can set `SKIP_BUILD=true` to save time.
- `FM_LOG_LEVEL`: Fendermint log level. Defaults to `info`.
- `FM_LOG_DOMAINS`: Fendermint log domains. Defaults to
  `Bottomup,Consensus,Execution,Mpool,System,Topdown`.
- `RELAYER_LOG_LEVEL`: Relayer log level. Defaults to `info`.

Create a `.env` file with your desired values and source it in your shell:

```shell
source .env
```

Lastly, be sure to source your shell's rc file. This step will vary by OS. For example, `bash`:

```shell
source ${HOME}/.bashrc
```

Note the `deploy.sh` script is also configured to deploy to Filecoin Calibration. There's really no
need to use it there, but the following environment variables dictate what contracts are deployed
during the deployment flow:

- `IPC_FOLDER`: The path to the IPC folder (localnet deployments will use the root `ipc` path; else,
  it defaults to `${HOME}/ipc`).
- `PARENT_GATEWAY_ADDRESS`: The EVM address of the parent gateway contract (default defined in
  `.ipc-cal/config.toml` or `.ipc-local/config.toml`).
- `PARENT_REGISTRY_ADDRESS`: The EVM address of the parent registry contract (default defined in
  `.ipc-cal/config.toml` or `.ipc-local/config.toml`).
- `PARENT_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN`: An auth token for RPC calls to a [Glif.io](https://api.node.glif.io/)
  archive node for the rootnet (Filecoin Calibration)—only used if you are deploying to testnet.
- `SUPPLY_SOURCE_ADDRESS`: The address of the supply source (ERC20) for all deployed subnets.
