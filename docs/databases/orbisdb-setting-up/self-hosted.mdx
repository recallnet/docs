description: Learn how to set up OrbisDB in the cloud.
---

Setting up your OrbisDB in the cloud is pretty similar to the
[Local setup](/databases/orbisdb-setting-up/local). To keep things concise, we'll just note down the
differences compared to the [Local setup](/databases/orbisdb-setting-up/local), as well as things to
look out for.

## Self-hosting in the Cloud

Follow along with our [Local setup guide](/databases/orbisdb-setting-up/local), but note these
differences.

### Ceramic

When running Ceramic locally, you end up with a Testnet Node that's running via CLI. To make this
production-ready, we recommend following the
[Running in Production](https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/guides/ceramic-nodes/running-cloud)
guide by Ceramic. The guide will go over running Ceramic as a service, connecting it to Mainnet,
accessing logs and more.

Check out Ceramic's
[hardware requirements](https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/introduction/technical-reqs#hardware-requirements)
to pick the right-sized server.

### PostgreSQL

Databases have a long history of running in the Cloud. You can opt for a managed setup or set up
PostgreSQL on a server yourself. Make sure to take secure your instance, never use default access
credentials and set up firewall rules if possible. Other things to consider are logs, high
availability, backups, etc.

Here's a
[checklist from CrunchyData](https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/is-your-postgres-ready-for-production)
as a good starting point.

### OrbisDB

The setup remains pretty much the same, however, we recommend setting up a reverse proxy to access
it. The OrbisDB instance will bind to your local port and won't be exposed to the web by default. A
reverse proxy, such as **nginx** makes it simple to set up your domain, SSL and manage the required
certificates. Here's a
[great tutorial by DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nginx-reverse-proxy-node-angular).

Alongside a reverse proxy, you should also consider DDOS protection. There are free options such as
[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) which also comes with a CDN built-in.

Running the OrbisDB by using `npm run dev` will only last the lifetime of your SSH session. We
recommend using [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) to manage your OrbisDB process.

## Docker **`Coming soon`**

We are working on Docker images to simplify the setup process with prebuilt binaries and bundled
options.

## Tips and Tricks

Here are some things to look out for based on our experience with running OrbisDB in the cloud.

### Security

- Never run your stack as the `root` user. Create a separate non-root user that will run your
  services.
- DDOS protection is a must in today's day and age.
  - Your hosting provider might come with built-in, but you can also consider options such as
    Cloudflare.
- Do not use regular username/password authentication for your server, always opt for a
  private/public key pair and rotate them if possible.
- Protect your server from bruteforce attacks with tools such as
  [fail2ban](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban).

### Scaling

- Scaling starts with choosing the right hosting provider. Make sure your provider allows server
  scaling (manual and automatic would be ideal).
- Some hosting providers work based on compute units, allowing your instances to scale to zero -
  this can lower your hosting bills during low usage hours.
- Storage is very important for Ceramic's IPFS process and your database, make sure you prepare
  yourself for the storage requirements with things such as add-on storage blocks.
- Horizontal scaling of OrbisDB isn't available _ootb_, however, you may consider running multiple
  OrbisDB and Database instances for high availability and load balancing.

### Backups

- Make sure you back up your storage and database regularly. Things can happen and being able to
  “roll back” to a previous point in time is a great feature to have.
  - Some managed database providers offer PITR as a feature. Same goes for server providers.
- Providers such as DigitalOcean offer built-in backups and snapshots for a relatively low price.

### Logging

- Logs will save you time trying to debug or understand issues/demands from your nodes.
- OrbisDB comes with a built-in logs viewer, however, this does not include logs from your Database,
  Ceramic Node or the server itself.
- nginx logging can also help you understand the requests coming through, in case you set up a
  reverse proxy.
- There are dedicated logging services, if you wish to set up a more robust solution.
- Make sure to purge local logs as they grow rapidly with high demand.
  - This can help save space and keep bills low.

## Alternatives to self-hosting

If you don't feel like you're ready to self-host your OrbisDB instance in production, check out our
[Managed section](/databases/orbisdb-setting-up/managed-studio) for a list of partners and options.

### Hybrid setup

OrbisDB is built out of multiple components. This architecture allows you to pick your battles and
choose which parts you want to host yourself, versus having someone else manage for you.

An example would be hosting the OrbisDB instance yourself, but using a managed Ceramic provider and
a DBaaS for your database.
