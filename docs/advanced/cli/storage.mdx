## `recall storage`

The `storage` command is primarily for read-only operations, providing information about storage
capacity and usage.

## Get storage usage

Get the storage usage for an account.

```sh
recall storage usage
```

| Flag                | Required?                | Description                                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-p, --private-key` | Yes, if no `address`     | Wallet private key (ECDSA, secp256k1) for signing transactions.       |
| `-a, --address`     | Yes, if no `private-key` | Account address; the signer's address is used if no address is given. |
| `--height`          | No                       | Query at a specific block height (default: `committed`).              |

The response will define `capacity_used` in bytes.

- **Example:**

```sh
> recall storage usage
```

```json
{
  "capacity_used": "0"
}
```

## Subnet storage stats

Get the storage stats for a subnet.

```sh
recall storage stats
```

This is a subnet-wide view that describes the total amount of storage available and the amount of
storage that is currently in use.

| Flag       | Required? | Description                                              |
| ---------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--height` | No        | Query at a specific block height (default: `committed`). |

The response includes the following values:

- `capacity_free`: The total free capacity in bytes (e.g., 1073741824 bytes = 1 GiB).
- `capacity_used`: The total used capacity in bytes.
- `num_blobs`: The total number of blobs in the subnet.
- `num_resolving`: The total number of resolving (non-expiry) blobs in the subnet.

**Example:**

```sh
> recall storage stats
```

```json
{
  "capacity_free": "10995116277754",
  "capacity_used": "6",
  "num_blobs": 1,
  "num_resolving": 0,
  "num_accounts": 10,
  "bytes_resolving": 0,
  "num_added": 0,
  "bytes_added": 0
}
```
