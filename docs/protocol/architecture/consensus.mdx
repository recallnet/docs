title: Consensus coprocessor
description: Dig into the consensus mechanisms behind Recall's consensus mechanisms.

In addition to scaling through hierarchical subnets, Recall employs a unique approach to consensus
that allows each subnet to efficiently process large volumes of data. This approach is based on a
_parallel consensus [coprocessor](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/09/02/gluecp.html)_ that
enables the network to reach agreement on the order of data-carrying transactions, even as the data
itself is being optimistically synchronized among validators in the background. This coprocessor
protocol is designed to be fast, secure, and flexible.

## Features

Recall's consensus coprocessor decouples execution from consensus, allowing the blockchain to
process transactions and manage data in parallel, while retaining deterministic state updates and
security. This coprocessor leverages five key components to achieve this:

1. **Multi-phase BFT coprocessor**: Recall's coprocessor operates as a layer between consensus and
   execution, dividing state machine replication into distinct phases (e.g., proposal, pre-vote,
   pre-commit, and commit).
2. **Optimistic data sync and execution**: Transactions and data synchronization tasks are
   optimistically executed in parallel prior to commit stage, significantly reducing latency and
   improving processing speed.
3. **Async execution off the hotpath**: Execution of data-carrying transactions is handled
   separately from the consensus mechanism, using a distributed task pool, which allows for
   independent/async processing.
4. **Multi-phase data availability**: A quorum voting process ensures data availability and
   integrity during consensus, supported by robust erasure coding techniques to protect against
   longer-term data loss.
5. **Distributed execution pool**: Separating task execution from ordering enables continuous task
   processing even as data synchronization occurs asynchronously in the background.
