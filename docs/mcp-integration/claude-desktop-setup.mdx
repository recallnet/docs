description: Configure Claude Desktop to use Recall's MCP tools
---

This guide will walk you through setting up Claude Desktop to work with Recall's MCP server,
allowing you to build powerful agents that can leverage Recall's storage, verification, and
competition capabilities directly from Claude's interface.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [Claude Desktop](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-desktop) installed on your computer
- A Recall account and wallet with credits
- Node.js installed on your computer (to run the MCP server)

## Setup Overview

<Steps>

<Step>

### Install Claude Desktop

Download and install Claude Desktop from the
[official Anthropic website](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-desktop).

</Step>

<Step>

### Access Claude Desktop Config

Open Claude Desktop, click on your profile picture in the bottom left, select "Settings," and then
navigate to "Developer" in the left sidebar.

Click on "Edit Config" to open the configuration file. This will create a file at:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

</Step>

<Step>

### Configure Recall MCP Server

Replace the contents of the configuration file with:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "recall": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@recallnet/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY": "YOUR PRIVATE KEY",
        "RECALL_NETWORK": "testnet"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Replace `YOUR PRIVATE KEY` with your actual Recall private key. Never share this key or commit the
  configuration file to version control.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

### Save and Restart Claude Desktop

Save the configuration file and restart Claude Desktop completely.

</Step>

<Step>

### Verify the Connection

After restarting, you should see a hammer icon in the bottom right corner of Claude Desktop's input
box. Click on it to see the available Recall tools.

To verify that Claude is correctly connected to the Recall MCP server, ask Claude:

```
Can you list the Recall tools available to you?
```

Claude should respond with a list of available Recall tools including bucket management, object
storage, and other capabilities.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Testing bucket storage and monitoring

Once your setup is complete, you can interact with Recall's storage system directly through Claude.
Here are some example prompts to test your configuration:

### Create and list buckets

```
Create a new bucket called "claude-test" and then list all my buckets.
```

<Callout type="info">
  When Claude creates a bucket, it will display the bucket ID. Make a note of this ID as you'll need
  it to access the bucket in the Portal.
</Callout>

### Store and retrieve data

```
Store a note in my "claude-test" bucket with the key "first-memory" and content "This is a test memory from Claude Desktop." Then retrieve it to verify it was stored correctly.
```

### Monitor storage via Portal

Once you have your bucket ID, you can view its contents in the Recall Portal:

1. Go to `https://portal.recall.network/buckets/YOUR_BUCKET_ID` (replace YOUR_BUCKET_ID with your
   actual bucket ID)
2. You should see all objects stored in that bucket

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<Tabs items={["Connection Issues", "Authentication Problems", "Tool Errors"]}>
  <Tab value="Connection Issues">
    If Claude cannot connect to the MCP server:

    - Check that Node.js is properly installed (`node --version` in terminal)
    - Ensure npx is available (`npx --version` in terminal)
    - Verify the config file syntax is correct
    - Try installing the package manually first: `npm install -g @recallnet/mcp`
    - Restart Claude Desktop completely

  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Authentication Problems">
    If you see authentication errors:

    - Double-check your private key in the config file
    - Ensure you have sufficient Recall credits in your wallet
    - Verify you're using the correct network setting ("testnet" or "mainnet")
    - Try regenerating your private key in the Recall Portal

  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Tool Errors">
    If tools are available but return errors:

    - Look for error logs in:
      - macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-recall.log`
      - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\mcp-server-recall.log`
    - Verify you have the correct permissions for the operations
    - Update to the latest version of the MCP package: `npm update -g @recallnet/mcp`

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Finding Claude Desktop Logs

Claude Desktop logs related to MCP are located at:

- macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Claude`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs`

The relevant log files are:

- `mcp.log` - General MCP connection logs
- `mcp-server-recall.log` - Specific logs for the Recall MCP server

To view the logs on macOS, use:

```bash
# Check Claude's logs for errors
tail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have Claude Desktop integrated with Recall:

1. **Explore available tools** - Ask Claude to describe each Recall tool's functionality
2. **Create buckets for different purposes** - Organize your agent's memory
3. **Build a trading agent** - Connect to the Trading Simulator through Recall
4. **Experiment with verifiable sources** - Create and manage credible data sources
