The Recall system facilitates new data-driven applications by connecting various participants in the
data pipeline through a unified, programmable data layer:

- **Data producers**: Entities that generate or aggregate data (social media, DePINs, blockchain
  networks).
- **Data service providers**: Builders who develop data services (e.g., Basin, Ceramic, indexers,
  compute).
- **Infrastructure providers**: Decentralized node operators that operate the network and ensure
  data availability.
- **Data consumers**: Users who interact with applications built on Recall, consuming or generating
  data.

All of this is made possible through a modular set of primitives that can be stitched together for
flexible use cases.

## Features

### Flexible, programmable execution

- Supports a **polyglot virtual machine** (VM) used to execute onchain data logic in both EVM and
  Wasm execution runtimes with familiar account patterns and tooling.
- Existing Ethereum developers (e.g., Solidity) can utilize the same data and storage primitives as
  Wasm (e.g., Rust) developers through VM abstraction layers.

### Lightening-fast settlement & consensus

- **Hierarchical subnet architecture** and layered consensus model that enables scalable,
  cost-effective storage and compute, competitive with traditional cloud providers.
- Offchain data service integrations, like Ceramic and Basin, allow **offchain data to be settled
  onchain** in an efficient manner and with **consensus over data state**.

### Native data availability

- A new _data availability_ pattern that is custom built for use cases revolving around **storing
  and managing large files with high throughput** in a decentralized fashion.
- Permissionlessly store and serve data that powers products and workflows within the ecosystem,
  removing the need for centralized hosting and storage middleware.
- Guarantees high availability of data, allowing customers to access their data at any time without
  significant downtime.

### Network-level access control

- Sophisticated **access control mechanisms** that ensure both data producers and consumers have
  control over who can access their data.
- Flexible monetization and data collaboration patterns through onchain rules and programmable data
  access.

## Components

The Recall datachain provides novel data availability mechanisms for large volumes of heterogenous
data. The protocol consists of a few different layers that build upon one another, enabling an
ecosystem to facilitate different ways to manage your data.

### Accounts

Like any blockchain system, _accounts_ (e.g., Ethereum wallets) are used to interact with the
network. All transactions are signed by an account, which uses the same cryptographic primitives as
Ethereum-style EVM chains (ECDSA, secp256k1) to ensure that the transaction is authentic and
authorized. Accounts pay for network usage (e.g., transaction fees to store data) and are used to
track balances and permissions.

### Credits

Recall also includes a novel _credits_ system to support usage-based pricing and predictable costs.
This brings a subnet-level accounting mechanism wherein credits represent some unit of resource to
perform a set of operations. For example, storing an arbitrary blob for a certain amount of time
would cost a forecastable number of credits, measured by the size of the data, the duration of the
storage, the computational complexity of the data processing, etc.

### Functions

At its core, Recall exposes _functions_, which are fundamental building blocks for task execution on
the network. These functions are implemented with Wasm-defined logic and are embedded into a subnet
at genesis. A function can be thought of as a single, atomic unit of work that can be executed
onchain.

The core data storage primitive is a _blob_ function. Namely, blob functions track opcode usage and
report gas spend for tasks such as downloading input data, erasure coding outputs for blob storage,
and more.

<Callout type="info">

All subsequent layers are built on top of functions. Currently, the only function available is the
blob, but others will be added in the future (e.g., compute for performing transformations).

</Callout>

### Contracts

_Contracts_ are arbitrary programs that run on the network. The flexible
[execution environment](https://fvm.filecoin.io/) lets you deploy EVM (Solidity) and Wasm (Rust,
etc.) contracts that interact with verifiable offchain data stored in the Recall datachain. There
are two types of contracts that anyone can deploy:

- **Bucket**: Key-value object storage for arbitrary data.
- **Timehub**: Merklized data structures for onchain data anchoring.

Namely, these are simply predefined contracts wherein a subnet is aware of the contract type and its
associated logic. Deploying these contracts occurs through a factory pattern.

<Callout type="info">

You can create new types of contracts that suit your data needs. Buckets and timehubs power the
existing offchain data services below, which is why they come as part of the core Recall system.

</Callout>

### Data services

Services integrate both onchain and offchain components to facilitate the storage and processing of
large data volumes. Each onchain contract above has a corresponding offchain service that offers an
interface for facilitating its usage. The first two data services on Recall include:

- **Ceramic**: Offchain event-log service that relies on the onchain _timehub_ contract for
  anchoring _events_.
- **Basin**: Provides an S3-compatible object storage service by utilizing the onchain _bucket_
  contract.

An additional layer of data service providers then build on top of the core data services to offer
additional functionality:

- **OrbisDB**: High-throughput application database with an index, query, and plugin wrapper around
  Ceramic.
- **Tableland**: Onchain decentralized SQL database whose state is backed by the Recall datachain.

You can learn more about each of these and how to use them throughout this documentation.

## Limits

There are a few limitations to be aware of when building on Recall. Keep in mind that services like
Basin and Ceramic have their own constraints, which are detailed in their respective sections.

- **Block time**: ~1 block per second.
- **Throughput (TPS)**: Hundreds of transactions per second.
- **Maximum blob size**: 5 GiB.

<Callout type="warn">

Note: TPS is rough estimate and may vary based on network conditions. The node design is still under
heavy development, optimizations are being made, and benchmarked tests are yet to be finalized.
