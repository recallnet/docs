# Examples

Today, Ceramic powers a handful of bespoke products that process composable data in unique ways.
Ceramic's stream primitives make it a great solution for databases that index data in various ways
as well as for aggregation pipelines.

### SQL Databases

[OrbisDB](https://useorbis.com/) is a SQL database built on JSON document aggregations, powered by
Ceramic streams and the [aggregation library](#).

### Vector / AI Databases

[Index](https://index.network/) is a vector database that makes it possible for AI agents to compute
vector embeddings of data sets and compose with one another to provide search and alerting services
over broad, public and private datasets.
