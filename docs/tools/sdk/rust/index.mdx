The Recall SDK is a Rust library that provides a simple interface for interacting with Recall
buckets. It is designed to be easy to use and flexible, allowing you to build applications that
interact with buckets in a variety of ways.

There are two primary crates that are used in tandem with the Recall SDK crate. All three _may_ be
required, depending on the use case, so let's break down what each crate does:

- `recall_provider`: Provides the means to interact with the bucket storage system via a chain and
  object provider.
- `recall_signer`: A transaction signer to help manage sending transactions to the subnet.
- `recall_sdk`: The Recall SDK itself, which provides a simple interface for interacting with Recall
  and uses the other two crates to do so.

## Installation

To use the Recall SDK in your Rust project, add the following dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`
file:

```toml
recall_provider = { git = "https://github.com/recallnet/rust-recall.git" }
recall_sdk = { git = "https://github.com/recallnet/rust-recall.git" }
recall_signer = { git = "https://github.com/recallnet/rust-recall.git" }
```

<Callout type="warning">

**You MUST own tokens and credits** to create a bucket and store data, respectively. The
[Recall Faucet](/intro/faucet) will send you testnet tokens, which you can use to purchase credits
with any of the Recall tools (SDK, CLI, etc.). The [Recall Portal](/intro/portal), for example,
makes it easy to manage credits and tokens instead of handling it programmatically.

</Callout>

## Additional dependencies

We'll also use the following, which are common for handling asynchronous network operations:

- `tokio`: Async file operations.
- `async-tempfile`: Create async temporary files when adding or getting objects.

```toml
async-tempfile = "0.6.0"
tokio = { version = "1.37.0", features = ["fs", "macros", "rt-multi-thread"] }
```

## Next steps

Continue onward to see how to connect to the network and interact with buckets!
