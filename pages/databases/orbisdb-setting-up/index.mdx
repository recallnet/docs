# Overview 

OrbisDB is built on top of multiple components, mainly PostgreSQL, Ceramic and the OrbisDB Node itself.\
You can learn more about roles of each in our Architecture overview (link).

How and if you're going to run each of these depends on the environment you're using OrbisDB in, as well as your hosting requirements.

## OrbisDB modes

### Shared

Shared OrbisDB instances allow multiple separate environments on a single OrbisDB instance - similar to a shared (multi-tenant) hosting environment.\
Each environment is logically isolated, including separate databases, owners and limited configuration options.

All environments share the same underlying hardware, network and Ceramic node.

A Shared OrbisDB instance has one administrator.\
They handle the core configuration such as Database and Ceramic connections.\
An example of a Shared OrbisDB instance is OrbisDB Studio (link), hosting multiple environments for users to get started with OrbisDB.

### Dedicated

Dedicated OrbisDB instances are meant to serve a single client (an app or a project).\
This means a single database, environment, owner (administrator) and configuration.\
Dedicated instances are easier to scale, as the load is predictable and depends on a single consumer. \
Most currently running OrbisDB instances are dedicated.

### Mode comparison

|  | Shared | Dedicated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Environments | 1 per consumer | 1 |
| Users | 1 per environment | 1 |
| Administrators | 1 | 1 |
| Scalability | 🟡 | ✅ |
| Databases | 1 per environment | 1 |

## Hosting environments

As is the case with other web services, OrbisDB can be hosted locally, in the cloud or via a managed hosting provider.\
This is true for each separate component, as they don't have to be hosted on a single server.

Docker images will be provided for a quicker setup.

### Local

Local hosting environment is the best way to start your OrbisDB development journey.\
This means all OrbisDB hosted will be hosted locally, including PostgreSQL, Ceramic and OrbisDB Node itself.\
Find out how to get started locally here.

### Self-hosted

Self-hosting OrbisDB allows for full control over each component.\
Each component can be isolated on a separate server or hosted on a single instance.\
Check out our self-hosting guide.

### Managed

Managed hosting providers allow a one-click setup.\
They handle hosting and scaling of the infrastructure, so you can focus on building the next big app instead.\
Get started with a managed OrbisDB instance here.

### Hybrid

Because each OrbisDB component can be hosted separately, this allows for a hybrid hosting approach.\
You can choose to run the OrbisDB Node yourself, but delegate Database and Ceramic hosting to a managed provider.\
Mix and match the setup to your needs, balancing between control and convenience.
