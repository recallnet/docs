The Recall MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation for interacting with the
Recall network. It allows AI development tools like Cursor and Claude Desktop to securely perform
on-chain operations—such as managing buckets and objects—through a standardized interface.

<Steps>

<Step>

## Installation and Build

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/recallnet/recall-mcp.git
   cd recall-mcp
   ```

2. Install dependencies and build:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

</Step>

<Step>

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```txt title=".env.example"
RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
RECALL_NETWORK=testnet
MCP_PORT=3000
```

The server requires the same environment variables as other Recall tools:

- `RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your wallet private key for signing transactions
- `RECALL_NETWORK`: The network to connect to (`testnet`, `localnet`, or `devnet`)
- `MCP_PORT`: The port number for the MCP server to listen on (default: 3000)

</Step>

<Step>

## Running the Server

Start the MCP server:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start listening on the configured port (default: 3000).

</Step>

<Step>

## Integration

To integrate with the MCP server in your AI development environment:

1. Ensure the server is running
2. Configure your AI tool to connect to `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port)
3. Use the standard MCP protocol methods to interact with the Recall network

Example integration in a Cursor environment:

```typescript
const mcp = new MCPClient({
  baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000'
});

// Create a new bucket
await mcp.createBucket({
  name: 'my-bucket',
  visibility: 'public'
});
```

</Step>

</Steps>
