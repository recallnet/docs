## Installation

You'll need to download the source code, build, and install the CLI.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/recallnet/rust-recall.git
cd rust-recall
make install
```

Once installed, you can run the `recall` command from your terminal.

```sh
recall --help
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Configuration

There are two flags required for the majority of the `recall` subcommands:

- `--network`: Specify the chain location with RPC presets and settings that map to either `mainnet`
  (not available), `testnet` (default),`testnet`, `localnet`, or `devnet`.
- `--private-key`: A wallet private key (ECDSA, secp256k1) for signing transactions.

As a best practice, you should create a `.env` file with the following and run `source .env` to
ensure the commands load these variables. The default network is `testnet`, so it's not necessary to
set the network variable unless you're developing elsewhere (e.g., local development uses
`localnet`).

```txt title=".env"
export RECALL_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
export RECALL_NETWORK=testnet
```

Then, make sure to run source it to load these variables:

```sh
source .env
```
