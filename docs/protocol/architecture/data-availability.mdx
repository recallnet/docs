Deterministic ordering of data commitments is part of the onchain consensus, but actual data
storage, synchronization, and function/task execution is performed offchain. Like most existing data
availability protocols, Recall relies on a combination of _random sampling_ and _erasure coding_.

## Alpha entanglement

Unlike many systems which use Reed-Solomon erasure codes, Recall employs
[_alpha entanglement_ (AE)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16210) codes, a specialized erasure coding
scheme designed for distributed systems. AE codes create redundancy with less storage overhead,
enhance data integrity through block entanglement, and enable efficient recovery of missing data
blocks without reconstructing large portions of data. This reduces repair costs and improves
scalability, even in dynamic environments.

Alpha entanglement codes are constructed by "entangling" data and redundant blocks in a
multi-dimensional lattice structure. This entanglement process _propagates redundant information
across the mesh-like structure_. This process allows for decentralized and scalable repairs,
supports random access to data, and optimizes storage by grouping data based on retention periods
(TTL). The result is a highly efficient, decentralized system that maintains data availability and
integrity even under challenging conditions.
