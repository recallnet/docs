title: RPC & API URLs
description: Recall nodes expose various RPCs for interacting with the network.
---

To interact with a subnet, you can use the provided RPC URLs below. These are public endpoints for
Recall nodes ran by the core team. If you're running your own node, you can use the local
development URLs. More information is provided for each of the endpoints in subsequent pages.

## Testnet

| Description    | Value                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Subnet EVM RPC | `https://evm.node-0.testnet.recall.network`     |
| Object API     | `https://objects.node-0.testnet.recall.network` |
| CometBFT RPC   | `https://api.node-0.testnet.recall.network`     |
| Parent EVM RPC | `https://api.calibration.node.glif.io/rpc/v1`   |

<Callout type="warn">

The Recall network is still under development, so these values are subject to change. Review our
GitHub repository to validate the values are correct:
[here](https://github.com/recallnet/rust-recall).

## Localnet

| Description    | Value                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------ |
| Subnet EVM RPC | `http://127.0.0.1:8645`  |
| Object API     | `http://127.0.0.1:8001`  |
| CometBFT RPC   | `http://127.0.0.1:26657` |
| Parent EVM RPC | `http://127.0.0.1:8545`  |

Note that the localnet, by default, spins up a dockerized three node network. The EVM, objects, and
CometBFT values increment by either one or 100, and you can verify this by inspecting the docker
images.

## Devnet

| Description    | Value                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------ |
| Subnet EVM RPC | `http://127.0.0.1:8545`  |
| Object API     | `http://127.0.0.1:8001`  |
| CometBFT RPC   | `http://127.0.0.1:26657` |

Note: Since no "parent" chain is used in a local-only network, there's no parent RPC URL for the
`devnet`.
