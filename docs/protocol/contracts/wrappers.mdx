title: Solidity wrappers
description: Interfaces for interacting with core Wasm contracts.
---

The Solidity wrappers are libraries that facilitate making calls to the Wasm runtime. Recall's core
protocol is written in Rust and uses a Wasm runtime to execute the core logic. This provides a
massive amount of flexibility, but it requires EVM counterparts to interact with any of the core
contracts, like buckets or blobs. It's recommended you use clients like the [SDKs](/tools/sdk) to
use these directly.

</Callout>

## Blob manager

The Blob Manager contract facilitates calls to the `Blobs` actor, solely focusing on storage
components (there are credit-related aspects, mentioned below). The following methods are available:

- `addBlob`: Store a blob directly on the network (note: this provides the onchain interface but
  does not handle actually uploading the data).
- `deleteBlob`: Delete a blob from the network for a given blob hash and the subscription ID.
- `overwriteBlob`: Overwrite an existing blob from the network.
- `getBlob`: Get information about a specific blob given its hash.
- `getBlobStatus`: Get a blob's status (whether it's added, pending, resolved, or failed).
- `getPendingBlobs`: Get the values of pending blobs across the network.
- `getPendingBlobsCount`: Get the number of pending blobs across the network.
- `getPendingBytesCount`: Get the total number of pending bytes across the network.
- `getStorageStats`: Get storage stats.
- `getStorageUsage`: Get storage usage for an address.
- `getSubnetStats`: Get subnet stats.

## Bucket manager

The Bucket Manager contract faciliates calls to the `Bucket` actor. Certain methods, like adding
objects, require you use it in tandem with the objects API to upload data.

- `createBucket`: Create a bucket for the specified address, with optional metadata.
- `listBuckets`: List all buckets for the specified address.
- `addObject`: Add an object to a bucket (while also uploading the data to the objects API).
- `deleteObject`: Remove an object from a bucket.
- `getObject`: Get an object from a bucket (in tandem with the objects API).
- `queryObjects`: Query the bucket with a prefix, delimiter, start key, and limit.

## Credit manager

The Credit Manager contract facilitates calls to the `Blobs` actor, but only the credit-related
functions. It allows you to do the following:

- `getAccount`: Get credit account info for an address.
- `getCreditStats`: Get credit stats across all accounts.
- `getCreditApproval`: Get credit approval `from` one account `to` another, if it exists.
- `getCreditBalance`: Get credit balance for an address.
- `buyCredit`: Buy credit for a given address.
- `approveCredit`: Approve credit from one account to another with optional fields (`creditLimit`,
  `gasFeeLimit`, and `ttl`).
- `setCreditSponsor`: Set the credit sponsor for an address.
- `revokeCredit`: Revoke usage credit for an address.
