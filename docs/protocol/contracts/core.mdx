description: Protocol contracts for hierarchical subnet communication and state management.
---

The core contracts manage subnet creation, token bridging, validator entrance, and all activities
related to the core maintaining consensus over state (checkpointing, etc).

## Gateway

The Gateway is a core component that handles cross-subnet communication and message passing between
parent and child subnets in the IPC hierarchy. It manages the transfer of funds and messages between
subnets through checkpointing mechanisms. For example, when you deposit or withdraw RECALL, the
gateway is responsible for ensuring both the parent and child subnet states are in sync.

## Registry

The Registry maintains the record of all subnets in the IPC hierarchy. It helps track subnet
relationships and configurations and works alongside the Gateway to enable proper routing and
validation of cross-subnet communications.

## Supply source

The supply source for a subnet is the RECALL ERC20 token. Funds get deposited (bridged) from the
parent chain (where the token was originally minted) into the subnet, and withdrawals are supported
as well.

## Validator gater

The Validator Gater controls actions like staking, unstaking, validator membership adjustments, and
validator power assignments.

## Validator rewarder

The Validator Rewarder contract handles the distribution of rewards to subnet validators.

## Subnet actor

The Subnet Actor manages subnet operations including: validator set management, collateral handling,
checkpointing, cross-subnet message processing, and configuration management. It acts as the main
control point for subnet functionality and governance.

When you see a subnet string ID values (e.g., `r314159/t410...`), the `t410...` part is the contract
address of the subnet actor but given as its
[low-level actor ID representation](https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/filecoin-evm-runtime/address-types#ethereum-address-manager).
