## Prerequisites

Prior to building anything, you'll want to make sure you do two things:

1. Get testnet tokens by visiting the [Recall Faucet](/intro/faucet).
2. Purchase storage credits with the tokens by visiting the [Recall Portal](/intro/portal) (required
   for storing data on the network).

## Resources

Then, you can dive into any of the following quickstarts to get started with Recall's infrastructure
and tools.
