## What type of accounts can I use with Basin?

Basin uses Ethereum-style private keys (ECDSA, secp256k1) for sending transactions. Under the hood, the FVM manages creating EVM accounts on the subnet, so you'll find that both EVM addresses (i.e., `0x` prefixed) and FVM (i.e., delegated with the `410` prefix) addresses are compatible with Basin.

## Can I use Basin with S3 tools?

Yes! Basin is S3-compatible, so you can use existing S3 tooling with Basin. Check out the [S3 adapter guide](/guides/s3-adapter) for more information.
