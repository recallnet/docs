Any of the core [developer tools](/tools/cli) can be used to create buckets, write to them, and read
from them. Every bucket is created as an onchain contract. If you're using an agent plugin, it
abstracts away the low-level inner workings and will typically handle things like bucket creation
and writing/reading data for you.

## Bucket creation

For example, the following commands will create a bucket with some metadata:

```sh
> recall bucket create --metadata 'alias=my-bucket'

{
  "address": "0xff0000000000000000000000000000000000008f",
  "tx": {
    ...
  }
}
```

Notably, the address `0xff0000000000000000000000000000000000008f` is the address of the bucket. They
will always starts with the `0xff` prefix, indicating that it was create at the low-level Wasm layer
(but that doesn't change anything about its usage patterns)

## Providing access to a bucket

If anyone is aware of this address, they can read from itâ€”but they _cannot_ write to it unless
otherwise granted access.

The [credit](/intro/concepts#credit) system is used to control access to buckets. For more details
on access control, see the [access and collaboration docs](/agents/access).
